        <text>WOMAN`S CONGRESS 1895
        The second annual session of the
        Womans Congress of the Pacific Coast
        was called to order in Golden Gate Hall
        yesterday morning at 10:30 oclock by the
        president, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper of tnis
        City. Before it had concluded its first
        days labors, the home, the new woman,
        motherhood and child training, and that
        universally interesting subject, marriage,
        were handled vigorously the latter, in
        several instances, without gloves.
        The beautifully decorated hall was filled
        to overflowing for quite a time before the
        hour announced for the opening. Every
        seat in the auditorium was taken, the gal
        leries were packed and jammed with fair
        women and their escorts, and the aisles be
        low were crowded with many ladies and
        quite a number of men brave men at that
        to venture into such a maze of feminine
        loveliness, wit and wisdom.
        The ladies of the auxiliary had worked
        hard to make the big bare stage look pic
        turesque, and their efforts were crowned
        with complete success. The walls sur
        rounding the platform were covered by
        tall, slender bamboo trees, which were in
        terspersed with a few good prints and en
        gravings. Handsome screens and shaded
        lamps helped to give the stage a drawing
        room effect, which was completed with
        pretty chairs and lounges.
        The presidents table was a mass of fra
        grant crimson roses, in the midst of which
        was placed a marble statuette of the fa
        mous Lucretia Mott. Susan Anthonys
        seat had been made almost as gorgeous as
        a regal throne. It was an antique, high
        backed chair, which the ladies had dsaped
        with old gold plush and wreathed with
        yellow marguerites, tied with orange rib
        bons the suffrage color.
        Flowers were everywhere on the plat
        form. Suspended from the ceiling,
        Womans Congress, 1895. could be read
        in large floral letters, and the left side of
        the platform was entirely banked up with
        an immense floral tribute which an anony
        mous friend had sent to the president.
        . Ana Susan B. Anthony herself, the
        grand old woman of womans rights, the
        evangel of the new woman, as new as she
        beamed upon the welcoming faces before
        her as the newest woman of them all.
        White handkerchiefs waved and hands
        clapped at her initial appearance, and her
        utterances throughout the day were em
        phatically punctuated by the warmest
        demonstrations. The Rev. Dr. Anna H.
        Shaw, the first lieutenant of Miss Anthony,
        received her full 6hare of the plaudits of
        the audience. Her utterances were mer
        rily pointed shafts at many things, none
        the lesE telling for their humor, and served
        only to strengthen the impression the peo
        ple had gained of the reverend spinster
        through the prints of the country.
        And the women of California. They, too,
        did themselves and their State proud by
        their efforts on the rostrum. The address
        of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, the president,
        was one of the most beautiful, direct and
        logical ever delivered from any platform
        in San Francisco, barring none. It evoked
        the warmest applause from the visitors
        and fairly took the congress by storm. It
        was epigrammatic and instructive, sound
        and witty, he extemporaneous interpola
        tions being particularly fetching.
        Miss Kelso of Los Angeles took occasion
        to come to gentle issues with if iss An
        thony during the afternoon on the ques
        tion of marriage bondage, and did so in
        a manner that most certainly has won her
        the hearts of those newly married and who
        expect to be newly married, at least.
        Miss Millecent Shinn and Miss Anna
        Stovall of this city also read papers which
        covered them with honor.
        The congress will convene again at 10
        oclock this morning, when a business
        meeting will be held and officers elected
        for the ensuing year.
        VIEWED BY A WOMAN.
        Miriam Mlchelson Clves Her Im
        pression of the Con
        gress.
        When I stepped into a Suiterstreet car
        Monday morning there was a woman
        seated in the corner opposite me. Her
        hair was a faded, grayish red, her face was
        lined and rather colorless, and her promi
        nent pale blue eyes were tearful and mel
        ancholy. But she was really more mind
        less than miserable, and her sorrowful
        appearance, it seemed to me, was due
        more to weakness than to woe. More
        women entered the car on its way down
        town, a mother with her two daughters, a
        grayhaired woman and others. Their
        faces were just the ordinary, preoccupied
        faces of women who havent much time or
        wish for thought or action other than the
        duties which are typically feminine.
        At Larkin street a crowd of women came
        in. They were on their way to the
        Womens Congress. You would have
        known it by the importantlooking little
        documents they carried, by the fuss and
        flutter of their conversation, by the de
        mure, businesslike style of their clothes,
        but most of all by an awakened sexless
        intelligence in their faces and the selfcon
        fidence in their brisk movements. The
        women already in the car looked them
        over from toe to bonnet; then their faces
        subsided into indifference and selfabsorp
        tionall but the woman in the corner.
        She seemed fascinated by the new woman.
        She stared at her, she knit her light brows
        feebly, and positively forgot her troubles
        in watching this new kind of female.
        When the car stopped at the corner and
        with a bustling dignity the new woman
        alighted, suddenly the old woman rose too
        in a dazed, uncertain way and followed
        the crowd. She passed into the hall and
        I lost sight of her.
        Women, women ! All kinds and degrees
        of women. They filled hall and balcony;
        they stood against the walls, and, stand
        ing, filled the aisles. They were enthu
        siastic and hopeful and full of excitement.
        I do hope theyll begin on time. Women
        never do, you know, said an excitable,
        welldressed young matron.
        Perhaps theyre waiting for some man.
        A mans name is first on the programme
        or rather program, chuckled a bright
        THE INAUGURATION OF THE WOMANS CONGRESS AT GOLDEN GATE HALL YESTERDAY MORNING.
        {Sketched by a  Call artist.]
        faced woman with short dark hair streaked
        with gray.
        The other smiled appreciatively, then
        she said, Well, you know, punctuality
        isnt one of womans virtues.
        I dont know about that, said the
        other stoutly. Im always on time and
        so are you.
        Yes, but we both were business women.
        Besides, you know, men make such fun of
        us about that.
        The shorthaired woman sniffed rather
        scornfully.
        This morning, she said, coming over
        on the boat there was just the homeliest
        woman I ever saw. A regular fright. John
        said, I bet shes going to the Womans
        Congress. 1 I bet a nickel she isnt. I said
        THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 21, 1895.
        So we watched her, and when she got off
        at Kearny street I collected my bet. But
        I got more than a nickels worth of satis i
        faction out of it.
        There was triumph in every womans
        eye when halfpast ten arrived, and with
        it the president and principal members of
        the congress. So much for mans accepted
        ideas of woman. But although there is a
        tendency in some of the speakers to at
        tribute all the ills that flesh and morals
        are heir to to the political slavery of
        women, I heard nothing at all of tyrant
        man. On the contrary, a gentle, forbear
        ing patience was manifest in most of the
        allusions to him. He is unhappily in the
        wrong, but that is his misfortune, not his
        fault, and with time and feminine reme
        dies they hope to enlighten and ultimately
        to convert him. I discovered, too, that al
        though the new woman insists upon shar
        ing mans political and business life, she
        intends that he shall be compensated by
        increased responsibility as husband and
        father.
        Every mother owes it to her child that
        he be wellborn, read an essayist yester
        day.
        And so does every father, she added
        in one of those significant asides, which
        characterize womens speeches.
        But the most striking thing about this
        womans convention is the spirit of com
        raderie it fosters. At Golden Gate Hall
        women are actually so interested in things
        that they put aside forms. Introductions
        are unnecessary. If you can tell your
        neighbor that that shy, sunburned, dark
        haired girl is Beatrice Harraden ; that this
        woman with the intellectual oval face is
        Charlotte Perkins Stetson, that that one
        who wears her hair in a gray mane down
        her back is Laura de Force Gordon ; that
        the bust is of Lucretia Mott; if you know
        which is Susan B. Anthony and the Eev.
        Anna Shaw; if you know who is the
        woman in the swell gown and the one that
        looks like a guy, the woman next to you
        will not hesitate to make use of you. I
        saw a young woman rise and offer her
        chair in a very gentlemanly manner to an
        older woman she did not know, saying
        simply, I should have liked to give you a
        seat before, but the crowd is 8O great I
        couldnt get out.
        These congress women seem to have lost
        some feminine vices and gained some mas
        culine virtues. Their selfpossession is not
        the assertive arrogance of smallminded,
        notorietyseeking females. Their convic
        tion is tempered with dignity and charity.
        Tney are not shrewish, and they deliver
        their message in a frank, goodnatured
        way. They have learned how to disagree
        without quarreling, and they are willing
        to admit that there are two sides to a ques
        tion and an infinite number of points of
        view. I dont know that this makes them
        more admirable to men, but it makes
        them more womens women. The audi
        ence yesterday certainly showed great en
        thusiasm ; they indulged in that feminine
        kind of applause known astheChautauqua
        salute, and the speakers were quite old
        womanly in their allusions to Dear Aunt
        Susan, Saint Susan B. Anthony, That
        martyr, Lucretia Mott, and Our dear
        Elizabeth Cady Stanton. But there is an
        accent of sincerity and evidence of un
        usual friendship among women in the ac
        counts of those old days when our ideas
        were not received with applause, nor our
        selves overwhelmed with flowers, as Miss
        Anthony gently expresses it.
        The congress woman is evidently deeply
        religious. Orthodox of the orthodox,
        said Rey. Anna Shaw. Miss Shaw tells a
        story well. She is the most manly, not
        mannisn, woman in the congress. Her
        voice is deep and full. She speaks clearly
        and can be heard all over the hall. She
        tells with a chuckle of Miss Anthonys
        wish to impress an Eastern audience with
        the propriety of their religious views, and
        of the unfortunate figure of speech she
        used when she introduced Miss Shaw as
        her right bower. But, gleefully adds
        the Rev. Anna Shaw, every man in that
        orthodox community knew what a right
        bower is.
        The religion, said Mrs. Cooper in her
        opening address, which is all for the next
        world and none for this, is good for
        neither.
        Amen to that! came in hysterical,
        quavering tones from the back part of the
        hall.
        Everybody turned around. It was the
        Old Woman with the faded red hair, who
        had sat in the corner of the car. Her pale
        eyes were bright with excitement, there
        were two red spots on her high cheek
        bones, and her hat was a little awry. But
        she was quite unconscious of peoples at
        tention. The chair upon which she sat
        had been to her a penitents bench, she
        had suddenly come to a realization of new
        womanhood, and when the next speaker
        said in tones of conviction: The new
        woman has come to stay, another heart
        felt Amen! from theback of the hall
        attested the Old Womans conversion.

        THE MORNING SESSION.
        Miss Susan B. Anthony and Rev.
        Anna Shaw Receive
        Ovations.
        The opening session of tbe congress was
        brought to order rather informally by the
        appearance on the stage about 10:30 oclock
        of the president, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper,
        leading the way for Miss Susan B. Anthony
        and the Rev. Dr. Anna H. Shaw. No
        sooner did the vast audience catch sight of
        these ladies than it broke out into the
        wildest kind of applause, most of the ladies
        rising to their feet and waving their hand
        kerchiefs in salute. The pioneer in the
        movement for female suffrage, spectacled
        and whitehaired as she was, was bright
        eyed ana active, and as she took the deco
        rated seat set apart for her she beamed on
        the happy faces before her.
        Mrs. Cooper wasted no time in the pre
        liminaries, and as the afficers of the con
        gress took their seats on the platform she
        rapped for order.
        Friends and coworkers, sne said, I
        see before me a great many faces that
        greeted us a year ago, and we welcome
        you, thrice welcome you, this morning.
        The blessing of God maketh rich, and it
        hath no sorrow. 1 And we are to have the
        j invocation for his presence and his blessing
        by the Rev. Dr. Brown.
        The eloquent pastor of the First Congre
        gational Church delivered a solemn prayer
        for the right guidance of the convention,
        the audience listening reverentially and
        attentively till the final amen.
        His Excellency the Governor, said
        Mrs. Cooper again, addressing the con
        gress, is, no doubt, attending the funeral
        services of our venerated first Governor,
        Peter H. Burnett. Hence, we shall be
        disappointed in not having the welcome
        of his Excellency. But we shall not be
        disappointed in having the welcome of tne
        Hon. Mayor Sutro. I introduce to you
        Mayor Sutro.
        There was more applause as the
        monarch of the cliffs rose and bowed to
        the storm ol greeting. He said :
        Ladies: The pleasant duty and honor de
        TuJ? H2 on me to welcome you to the City of
        the Golden Gate an honor in this case doubly
        appreciated, as I see assembled in this hall
        women from different parts of the United
        States who have spent their lives in devotion
        to the betterment of the human family.
        The aristocracy of European countries dates
        back to the dark ages, when Kings and Queens
        often made noblemen of free lances who had
        shown the greatest prowess and skill in war
        if  or the P ur P of utilizing their talent to
        add strength and support to the throne.
        Here in America we have allowed to be
        reared an aristocracy of money  our railway
        magnates, men who have accumulated enor
        mous fortunes by chicanery and oppression,
        and by evil means corrupted our Government,
        which is now domineered over by great cor
        porations.
        We ought to strive and develop in this coun
        try a different kind of aristocracy, that of
        the brain, of worth, of Intelligence and of ad
        vancement.
        If we take that standard we shall find gath
        ered in this hall a higher aristocracy than ever
        assembled in any hall in the kingridden coun
        tries of Europe.
        The participation of women the mothers of
        our coming generations ot meN in the selec
        tion of those who are to govern the country
        will elevate the Nation and give a higher
        standard to political affairs.
        AVomen are endowed by nature with a finer
        quality of brain power ; they have a sort of in
        tuitive knowledge of character and are gener
        ally correct in their judgment.
        I believe in evolution; I think It a part of
        evolution that women, who thus far, in the
        history of the world, have been denied a share
        in the affairs of government, should be per
        mitted to cast their ballots in favor of a puri
        fied and improved administration which will
        cause us to rise higher and higher in civillza
        Nothing could well be worse than our pres
        ent status; political bosses, corruptly hand
        ling the moneysacks of corporations, rule and
        debase our great country.
        Let noble women step in and restore the
        honesty, simplicity and patriotism of the revo
        lutionary fathers and all will be well.
        I see in this hall one woman Miss Anthony
        whom more than a quarter of a century ago I
        have seen, year after year, struggling with
        Senators and Representatives at Washington
        to obtain the political rights of women, and
        who has persistently since and continuously
        fought the battle of freedom, and I wish espe
        cially to do her honor and welcome her and
        welcome you all, and hope that you will carry
        to your homes kind and lasting recollections
        of your assembly in this Cty by the Golden
        Gate.
        I have the very great honor, now, said
        Mrs. Cqoper, stepping to the front of the
        platform and grasping the hand of Miss
        Anthony, of introducing to this large
        assemblage one who I believe has done more
        to lift up womanhood, to lift up humanity,
        than any other living woman. This
        I firmly believe. I have the pleasure of in
        troducing Miss Susan B. Anthony, who
        will respond to the Mayors address of wel
        come.
        Loud handclappings almost drowned the
        last words of the  president, and as Miss
        Anthony advanced the vast audience arose
        as one person and wildly waved handker
        chiefs in the Chautauqua salute to the
        whitehaired grand old woman of the rights
        of woman.
        Mrs. President, Mr. Mayor and friends,
        said Miss Anthony, as soon as the wave
        of enthusiasm had passed, it is but a few
        minutes over twentyfour hours since my
        friend, Miss Shaw, and myself stepped foot
        on California soil, and this is the third
        vast congregation of your California peo
        ple which we have met the third vast
        audience  and the welcome which your
        Mayor has extended, the welcome which
        these vast assemblages of the men and
        women of your City and your Brooklyn
        across the water for while lam here I
        can only think of New York and Brooklyn
        to be compared with Ran Francisco and
        Oakland do not fail of appreciation from
        me. Certainly any heart that could fail to
        appreciate such an ovation such a recog
        nition would be wanting in the common
        est elements of human nature.
        lam grateful for this welcome, not
        from any personal consideration. While
        that is flattering enough, I can assure you
        I take it for the cause for which you make
        the recognition. lam no better looking;
        I, personally, have no more brain, nor
        more power of statement than I had forty
        years ago and, forty years ago, whenever
        my friends, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and
        the venerated and sainted Lucretia Mott,
        whenever any of us went into a commun
        ity, the whole community did not take off
        their hats in reverent recognition of our
        coming, but, on the other hand, it was
        with hootings and with jeers and with
        words that were not complimentary they
        met us.
        It is because the world is coming, not
        to admire the exterior of Lucretia Mott,
        the exterior of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, or
        any of the advocates of this great move
        ment that this ovation comes. It is be
        cause the idea which these women pro
        mulgated almost half a century ago has
        become acceptable to the people, and not
        only acceptable, but it has become the
        cornerstone of the faith in our republic, of
        the faith in our Christianity and of the
        faith in our country altogether. There
        fore, whatever of courtesy, whatever of
        congratulation you offer to my friend, Miss
        Shaw and myself, who have come across
        the mountains and the plains in order to
        look you in your faces in the great con
        gregation whatever you tender to us,
        seemingly personal, she and I and all
        of the friends who are not able to be here
        today^Mrs. Stanton, the one survivor of
        the women who called the first conventiou
        that was ever held of women in 1848, she,
        sitting in her little room in her little home
        in the city of New York, will feel today
        this ovation, this congratulation, this ora
        tion, quite as much as we who are here.
        And everywhere where woman has awak
        ened to her new destiny, to her new hope,
        to her new realization, everywhere where
        woman has thus awakened all over the
        face of this globe, will go the Associated
        Press dispatches of this tender of recogni
        tion and respect and reverence for the
        women who first promolgated this grand
        idea of perfect equality of rights, civil,
        religious, social, literary, educational, for
        the women of the world.
        Loud handclappings interrupted the
        flow of eloquence from the lips of Miss
        Antnony, and the waving handkerchiefs
        in the crowded seats, the packed aisles and
        the jammed galleries, looked like myriad
        mammoth flakes of purest snow falling
        from the canopy above.
        I am glad to be here, resumed Miss
        Anthony, smiling at the smiling audience
        before her. You will remember, some of
        you who are old enough to remember, that
        this is not my first visit to your coast. It
        will be twentyfour years ago, when the
        11th day of June shall have come, since
        Mrs. Stanton and myself first arrived in
        your City.
        We are not without recognition then;
        we were not without a most cordial recep
        tion then, but it was not by the multitude
        as it is now. It was the few. I remember
        that when Mrs. Stanton appeared before
        the vast audience, Mr. Stanford, the then
        Governor of the State, made the formal ad
        dress of welcome and presided at the meet
        ing, and Mis. Stanford and himself ten
        dered every possible compliment to us as
        their guests at the Grand Hotel, which
        was then new and magnificent.
        We have had grand California repre
        sentatives in the East from the beginning.
        As I began wending my way back by the
        railroad on that trip, having just finished
        speaking at Virginia City and gone down
        to Reno to take the train, I found there
        was not a single berth to be had. All were
        taken. Your men had then elected as
        Senator of the United States, the Hon. A.
        A. Sargent. He and his family were then
        on board that train, and, very kindly, the
        two daughters of Senator Sargent shared
        their stateroom with me, and I found
        resting place and ;; became thoroughly ac
        quamted^with your Senator and Mrs. Sar
        fhnir?^ f m u that d y,to this 1 have had
        fo h noTin ln s a h n S |SsS ether   I 
        Then after Senator Sargent, you sent

        and Pennsylvania and Washington, we are

        Now, I will say again that I am glad to
        be here, and I expect to get a good deal
        more good out of this council of the women
        of the Pacific Slope than it is possible for
        you to get from nay being here with you.
        Aerain the hall rang with applause and
        the flowerscented air was agitated by the
        waving of spotless handkerchiefs as the
        honored pioneer who bad blazed the path
        for the new woman, bowing to the right
        and left, took her seat.
        There has been a call from the audi
        ence, said Mrs. Cooper, advancing as the
        applause subsided, for one who captured
        both Oakland and San Francisco yester
        day. 1 have the honor of introducing the
        Rev. Anna Shaw.
        I want to say to Mrs. Copper and to
        this audience, exclaimed Miss Anthony,
        rising before Miss Shaw had time to step
        forward, that Miss Anna Shaw is my
        first lieutenant, and she is not only my
        first lieutenant, but is the first lieutenant
        of the great National Womans Council of
        the United States. She is vicepresident
        at large. She comes to you representing
        that body, which is composed of twenty
        of the different National organizations
        of women of this country, representing
        twenty different purposes of the women
        who have been organized, and I hope be
        fore this Pacific Council shall adjourn you
        will vote yourselves members of that great
        National organization of the women of
        the United States.
        More applause, and Mrs. Cooper again
        introduced Miss Shaw, who came forward
        smiling at the white greeting of waving
        handkerchiefs.
        My friends, she began, ycu make me
        feel bashful, because I come with Susan to
        hold her bonnet, and it is honor enough
        for any young woman to hold the bonnet
        of Susan B. Anthony. But as you have
        called me here, I am almost tempted to tell
        a joke on her. Some time since, they toll
        the women in this movement that the
        were out of their sphere. Finding that
        this did not scare us, they said we were
        strongminded. Well, I would rather be
        strongminded than have no mind at all.
        Then, when none of these things seemed
        to have any effect on us, they called us a
        lot of infidels, and that nearly scared us to
        death. Heres where the joke comes in.
        One night in introducing me to a con
        gregation in a large church Miss An
        thony wanted to impress upon her
        hearers that I at least was not an infidel.
        This is the Rev. Anna Shaw, she said, an
        orthodox minister. She is orthodox of
        the orthodox, and she is my right bower.
        Now just think of the impression on
        that congregation, resumed Miss Shaw,
        when the laughter at her joke had ceased
        echoing. And the interesting thing
        about it was that every orthodox person
        in the congregation knew what a right
        bower was.
        Gentlemen and ladies, I certainly thank
        yon on behalf of the Womens Council,
        which lam representing here ; and I thank
        you on behalf of Miss Anthony, myself
        and the other ladies who have gathered
        from various parts of the country to bu
        present at this congress. I thank you o:i
        behalf of womanhood, because I think this
        congress means better conditions for the
        home and, if for the home, then for the
        whole world. President Eliot of Harvard
        says the home is the saproot of the state,
        and if that be bo, whatever tends to uplift
        the state uplifts the home. There can be
        no perfect state without a perfect home ;
        and there can be no perfect state, if the
        home is the saproot of the state, without
        direct connection between the saproot and
        the state.
        If you sever from the life of the state
        onehalf of the taproot you sever onehali
        of the power and vital energies of the
        state. That for which Miss Anthony and
        Mrs. Stanton stand is the direct connec
        tion between the taproot and the state,
        and we have come to see this great prin
        ciple accepted all over our country by the
        wisest and best people. We thank you for
        your welcome to our ideas and to our
        principles and, in the name of the
        Womens Council, which I hope to speak
        of hereafter, I thank you for this kindly
        welcome.
        I now take pleasure, said the presi
        dent, in introducing to you Mrs. Caroline
        M. Severance of Los Angeles, one of the
        earliest of those women who stood for suf
        frage, and, not only that, but the first
        president of the New England : Womens
        Club; 1 and if I were to tell all that Mrs.
        Severance has done for the Pacific Coast I
        should rob her of a good portion of her
        time. It is my great pleasure and honor
        to introduce to you, therefore, Mrs. Caro
        line M. Severance of Los Angeles.
        There was more waving of nandkerchiefs
        as Severance took her stand to the
        left of the president, at the rear of the
        magnificent floral arch. Her voice trem
        bled with emotion as she responded to the
        reception and she was visibly affected. She
        said she had neither strength nor voice
        enough to tell bow grateful she was. Her
        heart and her effort had always been with
        the work at present in hand and her in
        terest had never flagged since 1848. J
        Susan can tell, she concluded. We
        have been coworkers in a way.
        Yes, said Miss Anthony, once more
        rising, let me tell you about Mrs. Sever
        ance. Just fortytwo years ago, in the
        beautiful month of October, the third, or
        fourth, or fifth meeting of the womans
        rights convention we talked about the
        womans right to earn an honest living
        and to get an education just fortytwo
        years ago next October such a convention
        was held in the city of Cleveland. I was a
        guest of this dear woman at that time,
        Lucy Stone, Antoinette Brown, dear
        Lucretia Mott and Fannie Gage, as we
        called her, Ernestine Rose of . New York a
        Polish woman who said such beautiful
        things in broken English. I think we
        were nearly all the guests of Mrs. Sever
        ance. I remember that beautiful home of
        hers out on Euclid avenue a palace where
        we used to love to assemble.
        o Ah, how different it was then, Mrs.
        Severance, said Miss Anthony, turnine to
        her old friend. How different it was.
        Instead of having a preacher to come and
        pray for us, we actually had one take Mr
        Garrison by the nose. Yes, Mrs. Sever
        ance has been with us from : the , begin
        ning.
        The Rev. Ada C. Bowles of Pomona
        added her tribute to the work and worth
        of Mrs. Severance, and called upon the
        audience to give her the Chautauqua
        salute, which was done with a will. The
        president then introduced to the audience
        the following ladies, who made short ad
        dresses appropriate to the occasion: Mrs.
        John F. Swift, president of the Century
        Club of San Francisco; Mrs. I. Lowenberg,
        president of the Laurel Hall and Philo
        math clubs; Miss Mary C. Smith of the
        Ladies Literary Society of Santa Maria;
        Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eyster of the
        Womens Press Association of the Pacific
        Coast; Mrs. Eliza Orr, corresponding sec
        retary of the Womens Council of Califor
        nia, and Mrs. H. E. Brown of the State W.
        C T. XJ .
        Mrs. Ada Van Pelt then took the chair
        and introduced to the audience the presi
        dent, Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who was
        greeted with much applause and the sight
        of many fluttering handkerchiefs. She de
        livered the following address:
        Representative Women of the Nation and of the
        Pacific Coast Honored Friends: I thank Yon
        for your cordial greeting. Ab president of the
        Omans Congress Association of the Pacific

        found that no matter how strenuously -our
        opponents fought us, they wore always
        ready to hear our sldo.

        The splendid vote I hove received In the

        Company. 
        woman In the United States to go to Con
        gress. Miss Uelle Fllgclman, of Helena, Mont.,
        herself a staunch worker In the cause ot
        women and suffrage, tells mo that Miss
        ltankln Is a wonder woman, a woman
        who with amazing energy has given of
        herself and her money nnd her tlmo for
        tho cause ot womankind, and that now
        when women of Montana have the chance
        to reward her, they have grasped It to
        pay homngo where they feel It is due.
        Tractlcolly every nonpartisan club of
        women In tho State, tho women of every
        political faith, laying aside party lines have
        unequivocally como out and stumped the
        State for Miss ltankln. Miss Fllgclman
        tells me, for woman of Montana say as
        they cast their ballots, If It werent for
        Jcanctto ltankln, I couldnt be voting nt
        nil  To Jennctte ltankln more than to any
        other one womnn In Montnmt Is due the
        credit of winning tho right of suffrngo for
        Montana women. You see bho was In
        charge nf the suffrngo campaign which
        swept Montana two years ago, and which
        resulted In a victory at tho first referendum
        over held upon tho question In our State.
        In referring to the personal side of Miss,
        ltankln, Miss Fligclinnn says: Sho Is a
        keen thinker, a tremendous worker, and
        she has a thorough knowledge of work
        In Congress, gained through her experience
        an a suffrage lobblcst In two hesslons nf
        Congress nnd In tho Legislatures of New
        York. New Hampshire, Delawnre, Florida,
        North Dakota and Montana. Sho Is prob
        ably moio familiar with governmental ma
        chinery than nre many of tho gentlemen
        who already conBtltulo tho cog-t of the ma
        chinery. She Is also entirely familiar with
        social and economic conditions, having stud
        led and traveled extensively throughout the
        United States. Sho knows Montanas needs
        too. for sho has campaigned In every
        county In the Stnto. Then, too, she will
        have an opportunity to work, for tho cause
        of Prohibition In Congress nnd for the In
        terests of the children, and she will also
        work directly In Congress for the Federal
        amendment.
        We women of Montana feel, too, that It
        will be the most eloquent argument which
        could be put to the eastern Congressmen,
        who have hitherto Ignored tho demand for
        national suffrage made by the enfranchised
        women of the United States, to have a
        woman In Congress.
        CHILD LABOH HOBBY
        Miss ltankln makes a special point of
        the congressional work which Is needed
        for the little children of the nation. She
        dovetails her political plank of suffrago
        with that of decent legislation for children
        and national prohibition.
        Several years ago during one session of
        Congress, says Miss Rankin In talking of
        the need of somo one to represent the little
        children In Congress. J300.000 was appro
        priated for tho study of fodder for hogs.
        At tho Bame session JSO.O00 was nppro
        proprlated for the study of the needs of the
        nations children. If hogs of the nation
        nre ten times more Important to the men
        than are the children of the nation. It Is
        high time that women should make tholr In
        fluence felt In Congress. We have several
        hundred men In -Washington to care for the
        nations tariff and the Irrigation nnd the
        bogs llut there Is not a single woman to
        take care of the Interests of the children.

        Arrests followed In qulcl ruecesslon this

        tho White House, from which President Wil
        son nnd tho Allies diplomats were to review
        tho selective service parade.
        Two militants set up their banneis In
        froht of the stand and for fifteen minutes
        were unmolested. One banner was ad
        dressed to tho President and proclaimed tho
        Injustlco of conscripting men while denying
        their mothers a voice In the Government.
        The other standard was simply tho suffrage

        <text>41 SUFFRAGISTS FOUND GUILTY
        Three Philadelphia Women
        Among Those Convicted
        of Picketing
        SENTENCE IS DEFERRED
        Theyve taken the sentiment nut of
        everything, the Oermans have, he said,
        and Ood help the nation which does that.
        But weve got to llijk them, though It be
        long fight, and eery days delay means
        a casualty list of 3000 for us and 3000 for
        France. Thats a minimum, and Its thn
        figure that we count on when the days are
        quiet.
        The Oermans are such dirty fighters,
        thats what our men hate about this war.
        They dont mind clean fighting: they like
        It rather, the Captain smiled his nice
        mile, but you cant get any clean lighting-
        with the Oermans.
        He Illustrated a bit of rtlrty fighting,
        with a typical Incident.
        We had taken a dugout. he said, and
        the Oermans h id surrendered. Kamerad,
        Kamerad, they were crying, their hairtls
        uplifted. Theyro great on kameradlng,
        but our fellows dont trust them any more,
        and so as they advanced tun of our men
        had hand grenades In case of treachery.
        There were eght or ten of us to about
        eighteen of them. Along they came and as
        they got near two Prussian officers were,
        noticed at the rear fully armed. Thats
        the game they play. The Kamerad was
        a rap. OuP fellows let go at theni and
        thats all there Is to tell of them there
        was nothing left of them.
        The Prussian officer when taken a pris
        oner, the Captain said, la sullen and In
        tractable; the Krltz. particularly If he la
        Bavarian or Saxon, Is docile and overcome
        with amazement at any human treatment
        accorded him.
        He has been told by hla officers, the cap
        tain said contemptuously, that we would
        torture and then kill hlmand he believes It.
        It Is true, too, what you have heard about
        Herman gunners being chained to their
        una. I have seen that. Vhen we call for
        work like that we ask for volunteers. Ger
        many orders men and then takes no
        chances.
        HATK TO MAKK RBPItlSAr.S
        There Is talk of reprisals In England,
        the captain said softly, hut Ood, how we
        hate to think about It, I understand that
        we are trying to get men for this work who
        A i have, lost relatives and are particularly
        :, I bitter. But I doubt If we succeed, Our
        men will get their orders, but they wont
        make a good job of it: we are not the kind
        that can kill women and children. Wti are
        p , going to win this war, but I doubt If we

        Indpendents say this new move Is made
        In the hope of complicating the Investiga

        S. Tliom.iH, leiiirdlng secretary of the Hoard
        of lliglstratlnn Commissioners:
        Niiineious rmnplaluts have been umde
        tn the Hnard of Registration Commissioners
        regarding illegal registration in a number
        of wards. In Instiinics when dozen
        names appear from residences anil sup
        posed boarding and iipartmcnt houses, they
        do not have sufficient rooming place or
        beds for tho alleged registered voters.
        The Hoard of Hi gistratlon Commission
        ers In session this day respectfully request
        that a police canvass of registered voters
        be made lit once mi that the result of the
        lanvass and registration records may be
        compared for the alleged fraudulent regis
        tration supposed to nave been permilteu
        with the knowledge of the registrars.
        The commission therefore requests that
        you arrange to uinvass the following
        wards- First, Third. Sixth, Klghth, Tenth.
        Klghnenth. Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth
        and Thirty-seventh.
        Immediately after receiving icsulls or
        vour canvass, the commission will older tho
        registrars of the divisions In which the
        fraudulent registration exists tn appear he
        fore them for n henring.
        if the wards named, the First Is re.
        gnrdrd as the only Vare ward. The Third
        is controlled by Harry Trainer, tin Sixth
        and lllghth are Penrose wards, while the
        Tenth. Twentj, -fourth. Twrntv -fifth and
        Thirty-seventh are McNIclu.l wards
        With the completion nt noon today of the
        Sixteenth and Seventeenth Wards, the offi
        cial count of the votes cast at the last elec
        tion give William It. Nicholson. Town Meet
        ing candidate for City Treasurer, a gain of
        about 100 votes on Frederick J. Shoyer, his
        opponent on the Republican ticket. In six
        teen wards. The emmt Is completed from
        the First to the Seventeenth Wards, ex
        cluding the Seventh.
        The Seventh Ward has not been com
        pleted on account of the rather vague re
        turn sheets from the foutli division. Itn
        turns from the seventh division of tin
        Klghteenth Ward are also complicated. At
        thn order of Judges Finletter and Martin
        the minority Inspector of the seventh
        division of tho Seventh Wanl was bent for
        in the hope of unraveling the complications.
        Counsel for tho Republican City Com
        mittee, assert that the returns for these
        two divisions will show gains for Shoyer.
        Despite the small gain made by Mr. Nlchol
        son, the Town Meeting attorneys believe
        that when the Independent wards ate
        reached the figures will favor the Town
        f Meeting candidates In larger numbers;. They
        are confident that. In tlie case of tho filly
        Treasurershlp. Shoyers lead of little more
        than 2i00 will be overcome,
        It was expected that .lohp R. K. Scott,
        representing the Republican party, would
        fllo TOO petitions! to have ballot-boxes opened
        In the Penrose. McNIchol wards, but Mr.
        Scott said that this action would not be
        taken today
        The opening of every ballot-box III the
        city for a recount of the vote In tho 1338
        ilectlon divisions probably will be asked
        later today by the Town Meeting party.
        It was generally expected that the Inde
        pendents would file petitions today to have
        the ballot-boxes In two divisions of the
        Klghteen. Twenty-fourth and Thirty-first
        Ward and seven divinim of tin- llilit.

         Irregulartltles in thn divisions ipiestloneil.
        The claim was made by Organization at
        torneys that iQgaln of less than a hundred
        votes for the entire Town Meeting ticket
        will be shown when the total vote for the
        city Is counted. It was also prcdli-trd by
        the counsel for the Republic!! pint Hint
        should the ballot-boxes III some of the In
        dependent waids lie le-ncd th m Horny
        for the Vare candidates would be In
        creased to more man l.i.inio voles
        K. If I. Roach, secretary of the Com
        mittee of Severity, who is Investigating the
        election, sum lie welcomeil tlie action pro
        posed by Mr. Scott.
        If John II, K. Scott makes good his
        promise to file 700 petitions today It will
        save us that much work, said Mr. Roach.
        What we are after Is a recount, and we
        are not Interested In who files the petitions.
        Scott threats about the balloting In
        the Independent wards mean nothing.
        We are ready to Join In an appeal for
        a recount of the votes In any and all
        divisions, rcgaraiess or wiio won In the
        election on the face of the police re
        turns. The design of tho Vare lawyers In this
        move Is perfectly obvious. They re
        simply trying to congest the court with
        work. Ily getting In tho bulk of their
        petitions first, they hope to keep the court
        o busy between now and the first of Jan
        uary that there will not be time to open
        ballot-boxes In wards where every one
        knows there have been frtud and error.
        Thla effort will fall, There la plenty
        of time to open every ballot-box In Ihlla
        delphla, and thnt Is what wo aro after.

        took the case under advisement and said he
        would give It deep consideration before
        making the sentences known.
        Three women from Philadelphia Mrs.
        Lawrence Lewis, Miss Kllznheth McShano
        and Miss Cntharlne Lincoln were nrnong
        those found guilty.
        Attorneys for .Mrs. Harvey Wiley, wife
        of the pure food specialist, gave notice of nn
        appeal nnd she ws released tinder $100
        bond. The others, among wheni are Mr?.
        John Winters Ilrannan. social leader or New
        York, and Mrs. William Kent, wife of tin
        former California Congressman, were re
        leased under the $1025 collateral put up by
        Miss Mary Ingham, if Philadelphia when
        they were arrested Saturday.
        The suffragists were arraigned In Court
        In groups of fours, sixes nnd eights. Just
        as they marched In different croups to the
        White Houlie Saturday, nnd lifter each
        group wbh tried and found guilty they were
        asked by Judge Mullowney to step aside
        until nil forty-one had been tried, when lie
        said he would pronounce sentence
        Hy hie careful questioning of each of the
        prisoners ns to whether they had been nr
        rested and sentenced heforo for n similar
        orfense, It was plain that Judgo Mullowney
        Intended to give repeaters n sentence of
        perhaps six months and first-offenders only
        thirty days In Jail.
        Court opened promptly at nine, but It
        was eleven oclock before tlie casea of the
        Suffragists wero reached on the ilocketi.
        During the long wait the prisoners nnd
        their friends who crowded tlie court
        amused themselves exchanging newspaper
        clippings nbout their arrest, knitting socks
        and sweaters and discussing the recent suf
        frage victory In New York.
        Many of the prisoners brought suitcases,
        handbags and bundles containing toilet
        articles, clean underclothing arid other
        articles which they Intended taking to Jail,
        as all were determined not to pay fines
        DOCTOR WIL.HY AIDS HIS W1FI0
        Dr Harvey Wiley, of pure food fume,
        was In court with Mrs. Wiley, who was
        among the plcketers, and took a seat along
        side his wife nn the front bench. With
        iilm was Ravinond H. Dickey, a Washing
        ton l.iwjer. who had been ictalind ns
        counsel for Mrs. Wiley
        Police Sergeant Lee, in charge of the de
        tail which made the arrests, wan the first
        witness for the Oovernment. Ho raid tho
        forty-one suffragists, bearing their ban
        ners, came to the White House In eight
        croups at 4:30 oclock Saturday afternoon
        at a time when the Oovernment depart
        ments were letting out. Hy stopping at
        the west gate of the White. House they Imd
        drawn n tremendous crowd, which ob
        structed the sidewalks
        He had told eaci. of the pickets that they
        were violating the law, lie said, and dl
        reeled them to move on. Only one of tho
        forty-one maae any respnurw, mm iicii
        they declined to move they were arrested
        and taken In patrol wagons tn the station
        house.
        The one picket who made response, he
        Bald, replied:
        I cannot move until I get directions
        from our leader.
        The suffragists called witnesses who said
        tint crowd was not dense; and that it had
        formed because the news had been spread
        broadcast that the pickets would be ar
        rested when thev appeared, rather than be.
        cause the pickets wero there. Pickets had
        stood at the White House gates for six
        months and nobody paid attention to them,
        tho witnesses said, until It was announced
        they would be arrested, when great crowds
        gathered.
        Mrs John Winters Ilrannan. of New
        York, who was In the first group arraigned,
        made a scathing address to the Court when
        Judge Mullowney asked If any of the
        women wlsh-d to say anything before sen
        tence was pronounced.
        HOLD. PRKSIDHNT RKSPONSI1ILK
        We will hold the President responsible
        for this whole thing, because he will not
        urge tho passage of equal suffrage leglsln
        tlou fer us, shouted Mrs. Ilrannan.
        Your courts, your policemen, your Jails,
        cannot stop us in this effort to obtain equal
        suffrage. Whatever the verdict or this
        Cnuri may be we shall go on picketing, we
        sb-ill nlcket again at once and keep it up
        The responsibility for thin thing will rest
        upon y mi and not uihiii us.
        This aroused the Ire of Judge Mullowney.
        M, handed out a vitriolic rebuke for what
        be declared their wanton and willful breach
        of the laws of the country .
        Do you think It is the duty of the police
        to make the crowd move on and leave you
        women standing there with your ;

        I come from Utah, where I have lieen

        party. I rare here to help In this cause,
        and now I wnt to know why the Demo
        cratic parly had me arrested. .
        This question convulsed the courtroom In
        laughter and the ballirts rapped and shouted
        for order.
        Judge Mullowney nlso bent nlmot double
        with laughter. When he recovered hla Ju
        diction composure he said:

        to explain carefully that he was not repre.

        <text>Suffrage?Over There and Over Here
        By MARIE DE MONTALVO
        Editor "The New Citizen"
        SUFFRAGE is still an issue?except
        for Canada, an all-America issue.
        In the United States ten campaigns
        are now under way, some for the Fed?
        eral and others for the state amend?
        ment. In Idaho, New Hampshire, New
        -Jersey, Delaware and Massachusetts
        suffragists are campaigning to elect on
        November 5 candidates to the United
        States Senate who will support the Fed?
        eral amendment there when it comes to
        a vote, probably within a few weeks.
        In Oklahoma, Michigan, South Dakota
        and Louisiana the state amendment will
        be submitted by referendum on Novem?
        ber 5. Arkansas will vote on a new
        state constitution December 14, and this
        includes provision for full woman suf?
        frage.
        "Beat Baird" is the slogan in New
        Jersey of the state suffrage association
        and the National Woman's party. Sena?
        tor Baird, a Republican, is filling by
        appoititment the place left vacant in the
        Senate by the death of Senator' Hughes,
        when the vote on the amendment came
        up. He voted against it, and is now a
        candidate to succeed himself by popular
        vote to serve during the rest of Senator
        Hughes's term, that is, until next
        March. Suffragists are asking even the
        men of his own party to vote against
        him and elect Hennessy in his place for
        the few months during which the amend?
        ment will be under consideration.
        The same situation exists in New
        Hampshire, where voters are asked to
        defeat George H. Moses, Republican
        candidate for the Senate, opposed to
        suffrage, in favor of John B. Jameson,
        Democrat, who has come out in favor
        of it.
        The Massachusetts Suffrage Associa?
        tion recently passed a resolution char?
        acterizing the vote against the Senate
        amendment of Senators Weeks and
        Lodge as "contrary to the ideals of
        democracy as expressed in the civilized
        world,""and went on to say that the
        attitude of these gentlemen toward the
        womanhood of their country was one of
        indignity and blind prejudice?"one
        that liberal women will remember for
        all time."
        Senator William E. Borah, of Idaho,
        is the next under fire. The first volley
        has come from "The Woman Citizen,"
        official organ of the National American
        Woman Suffrage party, in which an edi?
        torial accuses him on eleven charges
        of "inconsistency, insincerity and injus?
        tice." Representing a party that stands
        for suffrage, elected by a state that
        has had woman suffrage since 189G,
        Senator Borah nevertheless stands alone
        in the entire Senate as the only suffra?
        gist who voted against the amendment.
        In Michigan a unique situation exists.
        Twenty-live organizations, political, pro?
        fessional, commercial?schools, churches,
        philanthropic societies, the grange, the
        Woman's Benefit Association of the Mac
        j cabees?practically every group of men
        i and women possessing any influence in
        : the statt;?have allied themselves with
        I the Michigan Equal Suffrage Associa
        i tion in its fight for the right to vote.
        South Dakota is a "first paper" state j
        ?which means that any immigrant j
        within a short time after registering his j
        , intention to become naturalized can '?
        voice his wishes by way of the ballot. >
        So the suffrage clause is combined here
        j with a citizenship amendment in an ef
        i fort to make the representation at the
        j polls of South Dakota 100 per cent
        \ American.
        Oklahoma presents unusual difficulty.
        ! An amendment to its constitution must
        : receive a majority of the largest num
        ; ber of votes cast for any candidate or
        ; measure at the election. Suffragists
        : here realize the alr-ost insurmountable
        obstacles involved, but put high faith
        . in the fact that Oklahoma is whole
        heartedly back of the President?and
        the President's attitude on suffrage is
        ; well known.
        In Louisiana, the first Southern state
        to have a referendum on this question,
        ! the measure which is to be voted on
        ! next Tuesday has the backing of the
        Governor and other men of prominence.
        ' President Wilson, too, has written urg?
        ing the passage of the amendment.
        Arkansas has already adopted pri?
        mary suffrage, which in a state univer
        [ sally Democratic in its sentiment means
        | practically all that full suffrage means.
        But it seems only a matter of time be.
        fore women will be casting ballots at
        the general elections, too, since \h_
        measure has been urged both by the
        press and by the Democratic party at
        its last convention. Women here have
        already demonstrated their interest bv
        turning out fifty thousand strong to
        j register their convictions at the last
        primary.
        So much for the various states. As
        for the Senate, which is expected to
        : vote again on the P'ederal amendment
        ! within a few weeks, since the conversion
        ; of Pollock, of South Carolina, who is
        slated to succeed Senator Bep.et on
        November 5, there will be, if all g0es
        ; well, only one more vote to win. And
        i suffragists believe that this will eorao
        : from New Jersey or New Hampshire.
        But?to quote a Tribune editorial of
        | September 30?"the issue of women's
        ' voting depends not in the least upon tfco
        ! one vote that may or may not be forth
        j coming to make the necessary two-thirds.
        I That issue does not hang in the balance
        j in any progressive nation in the worl-1.
        ! It has been settled, settled for all timej
        j in favor of progress and democracy.
        Only the ratification of this great for.
        1 ward step by our most conservativo _?
        ; islative body remains?a small detail in
        ! the history of a great reform."
        The Franchise in Canada
        ?
        THE Canadian House of Commons
        passed House Bill No. 3, an act
        to confer the electoral franchise
        upon women, amid a calm, matter-of-fact
        approval from all corners of the nation
        that is a commentary on the strange dif?
        ferences between northern North Amer?
        ica and the United States.
        The bill was a government bill, far
        more immediate in its effect and more
        generous in its provisions than the Fed?
        eral amendment now before the United
        .States Senate. Its smooth course in pas- ,
        sage was enough to make an American
        suffragist wistful for the simplicity of
        British procedure in legislative bodies.
        It was certain of passage from the mo?
        ment of introduction by the Union gov?
        ernment. It was introduced by Sir Rob?
        ert Laird Borden, Conservative Prime
        Minister, and found no opposition except
        in the innermost heart of Sir Wilfrid
        Laurier, leader of the Opposition.
        The bill gives the franchise at Domin?
        ion elections to all women over twenty
        ono who ?-ire British subjects, by birth
        or naturalization, provided they have
        fulfilled the usual residential qualifica?
        tions for voting in operation for the
        male electorate and are not disqualified
        by race, blood or original nationality to
        vote for members of the legislative as?
        sembly of the province in which they
        live.
        The bill made no niggardly provisions
        for women over thirty only. It does not
        attempt to insure supremacy for the rest
        of this generation, throughout the period
        of reconstruction, to male intelligence,
        as the recent British act enfranchising
        women does. And it bas a feature which
        will be even more satisfactory to Eu'ro
        : pean feminists than our Federal amend
        | ment: Danish feminists, in particular,
        have always maintained that women
        were more to be recognized as daughters
        of their fathers and what they were be?
        fore they happened to marry than of a
        status to be determined by their affec?
        tions or the marriage broker. Under
        j this new law a British woman can marry
        ! an alien, even a naturalized Austrian,
        ! and still maintain her citizenship and
        I right to vote, provided she does not
        swear allegiance elsewhere or other
        ! wise forfeit her citizenship rights.
        This is a precedent that should count
        much in making public opinion in behalf
        of a measure introduced by Repre?
        sentative Jeannette Rankin, permit?
        ting American women to keep their
        citizenship, whether they marry Boisse
        vains or Italian counts or Indians.
        The only concession in the new law
        made to Quebec is an amendment which
        provides that the suffrage shall not be
        granted in the various provisions on a
        wider basis than it has been granted lo
        men. In Quebec there still remains a
        property qualification, based on land?
        owning, salary or rents. It is to be hoped
        that this means wives will go on ac
        ? knowledged allowances; but Mr. Bureau,
        j who felt deeply on the subject, in a re
        ) cent debate made a point, too, when he
        I said: "When Election Day comes around
        a man who may have worked hard all
        his life may find himself in an old man's
        home, while the old lady across the street
        will be brought out to vote."
        A Word About Louisiana
        By ROSE FALLS BRES
        (Admitted to the Bar of Louisiana in
        1898 and the first woman to practise
        in State and Federal courts in tltat
        state)
        LOUISIANA-heart of the South?
        land, where pino forests reach
        toward the bluest of skies, where
        flowers bloom brightest and sweetest,
        where the great Mississippi pours its
        flood into the Gulf! Louisiana?where
        the counties aro called parishes and
        where tiny bayous thread their way
        through gloomy swamps, then unrt 1 like
        shining bands of ribbon over stretches
        of prairie and between great fields of
        cane and cotton! Louisiana?where in
        song and story the chivalry of her sons
        has been told since the mind of man
        runneth not to the contrary! Louisiana
        ?where the unwritten law and the Jim
        Crow ordinance pass current without
        protest or comment, where the old
        French Code Napoleon is the basis of
        all rales, and where prejudice and sen?
        timent are so interwoven that the march
        of progress has sometimes been stayed?
        Louisiana presents to its voters on
        the second of next month nn amendment
        to give women suffrage!
        New York women who take suffrage
        us a matter of course might ponder on
        some of the inequalities to which the
        women of Louisiana have submitted and
        which, it by gr?eat good chance the
        amendment should receive a majority
        of votes at the coming election, they
        will seek to remedy.
        In that state so well established has
        the rule been that a woman must be
        guided in all things by her husband that
        the one act she was permitted to carry
        out without direction had. to be pro?
        vided for. Artick 136 of the code
        reads:
        "The wife may make lier last will and
        testament without the authorization of
        bet hosband." .
        -~~-'-I
        Of course, the fact that she has to ;
        die in order to make this one act effec?
        tive rather lessens . her satisfaction.
        Then, too, there is Article 90 of the
        code, which reads:
        "As the law considers marriage in no
        other way than that of civil contract,
        it sanctions all those marriages where
        the parties at the time were willing to
        contract and did contract according to
        the forms and solemnities prescribed by
        law."
        But the contract was manifestly uni?
        lateral, since Article 24 says:
        "Laws, on account of the differer.ee
        of sexes, have established between men
        and women essential differences with
        respect to cjvil, social anil political
        rights."
        Article 1782 continues:
        "All persons have the capacity to
        contract except those whose ineapacity
        is specially declared by law. These are
        persons of insane mind, those who bare
        interdicted and married women."
        It is of record that a suit, was tried
        before a judge of the Civil District
        Court where both plaintiff and defend?
        ant were women and all of the wit?
        nesses were women. The judge, at the
        close of the case, entered a judgment of
        non-suit, saying that there had been
        nothing before the court.
        When what is known as a "family
        meeting" is convened for the purpose of
        disposing of the property of a minor it
        is expressly stipulated by the code that
        only "male relatives" may be called.
        When a suit is brought in Louisiana
        by a married woman she must be au?
        thorized by her husband to sue and
        stand in judgment, and to sue a married
        woman without citing her husband
        would not be allowed.
        Not only must the husband appear
        i and authorize his wife to purchase rea!
        estate, but if property is left to her and
        I for any reason she does not wish to ac?
        cept it ho may appear'and accept foi
        ! her.
        In the cities of Louisiana and in th<
        smallest of the parish towns the worn
        i en of the state are campaigning foi
        freedom, and as Louisiana votes, so, if
        may be expected, will other Southen

        The Senate and the Clock of Progress
        WOMEN may be e?xcused for
        e.xhibiting some impatience
        when statesmen hesitate
        and haggle over a measure of such
        vital importance to the sex as the
        suffrage amendment. They find it
        hard to comprehend why gentlemen
        who can see the wisdom of appro?
        priating billions for the common de?
        fence, and the necessity of sending
        millions of our young men to fight
        for the nation's safety, should so
        utterly fail to appreciate the fact
        that the whole theory on which we
        wage war is untenable unless a
        sword is put in women's hands at
        home wherewith to protect them?
        selves.
        It is merely incidental that the
        "best" voters of the country are in
        France and women must take their
        places if the quality of national rep?
        resentation in Washington is to be
        kept up or improved. If the suf?
        frage amendment in any circum?
        stance is not a war measure, there
        is no such thing as a war measure.
        The color question is causing op?
        position from the South, unfortu?
        nately, and Senator Baird, of New
        Jersey, sees in his state's rejection
        of suffrage some time ago a plausi?
        ble basis on which to put his con?
        tinued opposition. It is felt that he,
        in common with other "objectors,"'
        has failed utterly to grasp the sig?
        nificance of the world war in its re?
        lation to the emancipation of
        women. Three years ago, perhaps,
        the necessity for action was not so
        I acute that extension of women's !
        rights, state by state, was unsatis- '.
        '? factory, but the need now is real '
        ; and immediate. The war has made
        1 this perfectly, obvious. Woman is
        making shells in a politicalsituation .
        that is based on conditions which ,
        : existed when no woman worked ?
        outside of her own home and the j
        - -Courtesy "Tho Woman Citizen "
        "Those are my sentiments"
        . industry of the world was carried !
        on entirely by men.
        It would be well if Senator Baird i
        i and otherSenatorscould go through
        the experience which resulted in |
        ' the conversion of Edward W.
        I Bok, editor of "The Ladies' Home
        ; Journal," formerly a radical oppo
        ; nent of suffrage. Mr. Bok did not
        . doubt the sincerity of Roosevelt's
        ? conversion to the cause, but was
        I curious about it. "The trouble with
        you is that you are ignorant on the
        subject," averred Roosevelt. "I'll
        send you some books. Read them
        and you may change your mind."
        Some days later an express wagon
        drove up to Mr. Bok's residence in
        Merioii and began unloading long,
        heavy boxes. It appeared to the
        editor that some e.xcavating expedi?
        tion in Palestine had been favoring
        him with specimens of its finds.
        The boxes, however, happened to be
        filled with the"some books" to which
        Roosevelt had referred. Mr. Bok
        began a course in reading. He was
        amazed to discover that: each vol?
        ume had within it indisputable evi?
        dence of having been gone over
        carefully by the ex-President. There
        were authoritative analyses of suf?
        frage in the Scandinavian states, in
        New Zealand, everywhere on earth
        that the experiment had been tried.
        What had happened to Roosevelt
        now happened to Mr. Bok. He also
        became a convert. It is u pity that
        the same selection of volumes can?
        not be read nowby busy Senators.
        though there should be no need of
        it, so much more convincing have
        suffrage arguments since become.
        The unanswerable one is that the
        j Hun's plan to turn back the hands
        ? of the clock has as a fundamental
        | feature the driving back of woman
        I to the position she occupied a thou
        j sand years ago. The hands cannot
        ! be turned forward unless woman
        j goes forward with them.
        P. N. WHALEV.
        The N. Y. Infirmary for Women and Children
        PHYSICIANS on the staff of the
        New York Infirmary for Women
        and Children, 321 East Fifteenth
        Street, one of the few institutions in the
        country conducted by women for women,
        are preparing to extend the free service
        which they render to the people of the
        lower East Side, when additional large
        numbers of men are taken from that sec?
        tion for army service under the new draft
        law.
        These women feel that there is great
        opportunity to do their bit in this way,
        for they believe that a soldier whose de?
        pendents will not be neglected in illness
        while he is absent will bo heartened for
        bis task. The abundance of service flags
        in the tenements in the vicinity of the
        infirmary shows the great response of
        the men of the lower East Side to the
        country's call, for thousands of them
        have volunteered with the full assent of
        their families.
        When a woman or child in the vicinity
        of the infirmary who has been accus?
        tomed to depend upon a man for support
        becomes ill there is not in many eases
        sufficient money to pay even a modest fee
        to a physician. ??lany prefer to suffer
        rather than apply for free treatment, and
        othci\s are ignorant of how to make such
        application even if they desire to do so.
        The women doctors of the infirmary
        seek out such cases as far as they can.
        In addition to the free medical service
        that is given, a social service department
        is conducted at the infirmary, which was
        the pioneer in this country in that impor?
        tant branch of adjunct medical help.
        If they cannot extend this help directly,
        as in the case of the family of a Boldier
        whose allotment of pay has not been re?
        ceived, they are able to put the needy
        ones in touch with an agency which will
        be of direct, practical assistance to them
        for the immediate object that is'sought
        "These women need stabilizing," saic
        Miss Lucy F. Ryder, superintendent oi
        the infirmary. "If there is no man in the
        family to turn to and if misfortune be
        falls them they are almost helpless."
        The activities of the infirmary amonf
        the dependents of men in service includ?
        daily clinics for all diseases, maternit:
        care and a general out-practic. depart
        ment, besides the social service work
        Especial attention is devoted to pre nata
        and baby clinics, which are well attende?
        ! by the wives of soldiers and sailors. The
        | ignorance shown by many of tho lower '
        East Side mothers in the problams which
        are most important to them is apparent
        to the women doctors, whose first tesk is
        to win their confidence and thus gradu?
        ally to help them out of their difficulties
        as far as that is possible.
        "The appearance of a soldier's baby,
        greater exertions by the kindly "xdvice of
        the jjjiysician.
        Sometimes these conversations develop
        conditions that must be remedied at once
        in order that the mother may have a
        chance to take proper care of horsclf and
        her children.
        "You may give a patient alt kinds of
        medicine," said Miss Ryder, "but if there
        The first training camp
        ! which one of the women held in her arm;s
        : at a recent clinic, showed that it lacked
        proper nourishment," s.-ud Miss Ryder.
        " 'What can I do?' the mother asked in the
        most imploring manner. I told her to go
        to a milk station and get food for the
        j baby. 'Where ?3 it';' she asked. When I
        I told her that the station was on Eleventh
        i street she inquired again: 'Where is
        j Eleventh Street?' "
        In many cases the women doctors have
        ' to make use of all the devices of which
        : they can think in order to win the confi
        ! dence of their patient.;. This applies
        j especially to the foreign element. There
        j must be not a' little, talk .about subjects
        which are not essential to the purpose in
        hand before the mother can tako in the
        fact not only that tho woman doctor's
        aim is to help her, but that the doctor
        possesses sufficient skill to render neces?
        sary service. When the babies are -Mean
        and otherwise well cared for the mothers
        j are greatly pleased by a little compli
        i ment, and are willing to be spurred to
        i is something that is greatly disturbing
        I her it will do her no good. Of tea we. find
        I that there is a condition back of the
        i symptoms that must be remedied before
        I we can render really useful help. This is
        ? why the social service work is so inrpor
        j taut to us. It is the aim of the New
        i York Infirmary for Women and Children
        ! always to raise the family of a patient to
        ; a satisfactory standard of living. Even
        women and children who need eyeglasses
        receive them free, and in some c.?se;i this
        increases materially their scanty earning
        j power."
        Dr. Annie S. Daniel, who has worked
        j for many years on the East Side and is
        i considered an angel of mercy in hundreds
        ? of homes there, is in charge of the in
        ! rirmary's out-practice department. She
        ! receives an expense fund, contributed by
        j individuals who know the great good
        which she can do with the money. Most
        of this is spent on food and the rest on
        ice and coal.
        A campaign is now being conducted
        to add S'JDO.OOO to the hospital's fund.
        No better use can be found for your
        money than to add a few dollars to it.
        v.? Institute
        jgj The New Citizen
        Ballots at the Antipodes
        AUSTRALIA granted franchise to j
        women by states beginning in 1894 |
        and ending with the bestowal of
        full, nation-wide elective privileges and
        the right to sit in representath-e assem- '
        blies in 1908. According to Lady Holder, j
        wife of Sir Frederick W- Holder, '
        Speaker of the House of Representatives, |
        suffrage came easily and naturally?< .
        there was no "shrieking sisterhood."
        "The newspapers," she is quoted as say?
        ing, "gave special attention to women at ;
        the time, and teemed with exhortations ?
        telling them what to do"; and those who
        had most opposed the measure were loud?
        est in then- approval and advice. (Can
        it be that this has a familiar ring to the
        ear? of New York women?)
        And the result of it all was, to quote
        Lady Holder again, that "women have
        become more interested in the world out?
        side and men more interested in the
        home"?and she concludes with saying
        that she finds it less difficult to vote than
        to match a l-ibbon!
        New Zealand, which has been called an
        ideal spot for social experiments because
        of its geographical isolation and its small
        population, was the first nation to grant
        suffrage to women. The idea was
        presented as early as 1843, it is said, by
        two gentlemen?Alfred Saunders and
        William Fox?although the Hon. Hugh
        H. Lusk, then a member of Parliament,
        claims that it originated wifh him in
        1877. The first thin wedge, he says,
        was inserted when he conceived the plan
        in that year of omitting the word "male"
        before the word "householder" in a bill
        under consideration to empower house?
        holders within a. district to elect a school
        committee.
        Tho word "male' was omitted, and the
        little experiment began. Result: Wom?
        en showed such intelligent interest in
        their new power that they were forth
        with elected members of the schooi
        boards. So when in 1882 the question
        arose of giving ratepayers the license to
        vote, what more natural than that women
        should be included in this measure, too?
        The year 1886 found municipal suf?
        frage quietly granted them also; and full
        suffrage came in 1893, with eligibility to
        all elective offices except membership in
        Parliament.
        At the first election thereafter 83 per
        cent of the women qualified to vote went
        to the polls, although they had never
        gone before?and only TO per cent of the
        men, who had enjoyed the privilege for
        years. But did antagonism result, fna?
        this'.' No, indeed! The effect, in that
        Utopian land, was to rouse men lo their
        responsibility, so that now they are as
        active as the women. And, as one man
        put it, "when men suddenly found they
        could take their wives and daughters to
        meetings with them a new and better
        family life began."
        New Zealand women, according to Sir
        Joseph George Ward, who wj?s then nre
        mier. are inclined to vote with their fam
        \ ilies and are true to their class; but they
        i are less hampered by tradition than are
        : men. When asked whether they advo?
        cate "pet reforms" he replied that they
        rather constituted themselves an "exam?
        ining board" devoted to the public in?
        terest.
        "Tell your friends at home not to be
        discouraged," he said to a British suf?
        fragist before women were enfranchised
        in England. "Political enfranchisement
        came to the women of New Zealand with
        dramatic suddenness, and by a mann'?
        of only two votes. But if votes of appro?
        bation could be taken on it now I doubt
        if two could be found against it"
        And that, if he were asked, would
        probably be bis message to American
        suffragists who are now working for
        those ?ame fatal two votes that won
        the franchise in New Zealand mar>v
        years ago.
        Europe and the Woman Vote
        By LEON LANSBERG
        DESPITE the war, or rather as a
        consequence of the war, the wom?
        an suffrage movement has gained
        considerable successes all the world over.
        ! Emilie Gourd, president of the Swiss
        ; Woman Suffrage Alliance, strikes in the
        \ "Journal de Gen?ve" the annual balance,
        i and in doing so publishes the following
        i interesting statistics:
        In the United States eight more states
        I have during the last year introduced
        j woman suffrage, and, among them, in
        I first line, the State of New York- With
        j this addition, twenty states out of forty
        i four have granted the vote to women.
        : Already the. national House of Repre
        ? sentatives has voted to submit to the
        ; states a eonstitutional amendment for
        woman suffrage, and there is good rea
        ; son to believe that sooner or later the
        ! Senate also will approve the resolution.
        The Russian revolution has proclaimed
        | the equality of man and woman under
        I the law, and in the future Russian Re
        i public women will vote.
        In Finland twenty-four women are
        active in the food office.
        In Norway women have the active and
        ; passive elective franchise.
        In Denmark they have for the first
        time availed themselves of their fran?
        chise on the occasion of the referendum
        on the cession of the Danish West Indies
        to the United States.
        In Sweden woman suffrage is so far
        introduced in communal affairs only,
        because the obstinate resistance of the
        conservatives prevents women's political
        activity.
        England has resolved to grant the
        vote to all women over thirty years of
        age, this limitation being necessary in
        order to prevent the prevalence of the
        female vote over that of the lords of
        creation. The woman suffrage aft
        was adopted in the lower house with 383
        votes against W? in January, 1017, and
        approved in the House of Lords by a
        majority of votes in January of thr
        year.

        capable women candidates are figuring
        The question is only whether or not the
        men are going to honor women by elect?
        ing-them to office.
        In France woman suffrage has ardent
        advocates and the question is being over ?
        and over again taken up and advocates
        in Parliament and brought nearer to  !
        , victorious solution. Maurice Barrea rt
        is known, has demanded that widows of
        war be granted the vote.
        In Italy, too, the feminist wave h?

        lure the New Voters
        By Carter Field
        WASHINGTON, Aug. 18.--Enfran?
        chisement of women in very state is
        likely to help the Republicans on the
        Presidency, but, on the other hand,
        help the Democrats in their fight to
        control the Senate.
        Political Washington was busy to?
        night checking up, with a view to de?
        termining how the situation would be
        affected by this army of additional
        voters.
        By far the most prevalent view, ap?
        parently, is that the women voters
        will divide along pretty much the same
        lines as the men in the forthcoming
        election, and as a result change the
        situation v^ry little. But there are a
        few exceptions to thise.
        Republican States Lead
        Those who think Harding will get
        more than the Republican share of the
        women voters seem to present the
        most convincing argument. They wave
        aside the contention that the thirty
        sixth state is Democratic, and the
        women may therefore be expected to
        lie grateful, by calling attention to
        fact that of the thirty-six states which
        did ratify the amendment twenty-nine
        ?-re Republicans ami only seven Demo?
        cratic.
        These observers say the proportion;
        of women favoring prohibition is much |
        greater than the proportion of drys
        among the male voters. The fact that
        Cox was nominated by wet political !
        bosses, and that his campaign is being j
        aided by a subtle moist appeal direct?
        ed particularly at the wet centers of
        New York, New Jersey and Wiscon?in,j
        will, it is thought, result in driving aj
        tremendous number of women to the
        polls to vote for Harding as a rebuke
        to tho wet leaders.
        This view, incidentally, is strongly
        held by (le?era 1 Counsel Wayne B.
        Wheeler of the Anti-Saloon League.
        Not all women are dry, of course, j
        Mr. WheeW tolil The Tribune corre?
        spondent after hearing the news from |
        Tennessee, but the great majority of i
        women are not only dry, but anxious
        to see a rigorous enforcement of the
        dry laws. You will find that tho
        women in this election will not vote]
        for any candidate who makes an appeal j
        to the hopes of the wets. Their votes
        will aid tremendously the candidate
        who promises strict law enforcement.
        Women Foes to Liquor Interests
        Then, too, the women know that the j
        liquor forces have always opposed I
        woman suffrage because of the knowl- j
        edge of the wets that women would ;
        vote for prohibition. So they have
        come to regard the liquor interests as
        their enemies, with the result that
        their desire to end the liquor traffic is
        given an added incentive.
        Democrats here wave this aside, say?
        ing that prohibition is not an issue
        in this campaign and that the women
        voters, being naturally more eager!
        about progressive legislation, will
        naturally turn to the more progressive
        candidates, not only for President, but |
        for Senators and members of the House |
        of Representatives. They say the
        granting of the ballot to the women
        of all 111? states will be of enormous
        h elf) to Cox and to the winning of a
        Democratic Senate and House.
        The state in which the wet and dry
        element is ant to enter stronger than
        any other, it is said, is New Jersey, j
        The tremendous vote given Governor i
        Edwards, running on a Wet as the!
        Atlantic Ocean platform last year, |

        England has six votes to Americas
        one.
        It is just the other way, he went
        on. As a matter of fact, the United
        States has about twelve votes in the
        assembly. Until last week I had two
        of them myself and now Secretary
        Daniels has them. You know I have ?

        All along I have wished for the completion of ratifio#tion, and
        have said so, and I am glad to have all the citizenship of the United
        States take part in the Presidential election. The Republican party
        will welcome the response of American womanhood to its appeal to
        the confidence of all our people.
        COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 18.?The following statement was issued
        to-day by Governor Cox:
        The civilization of the world is saved. The mothers of America
        will stay the hand of war and repudiate those who trifle with a great
        principle. The action of the Tennessee Legislature has another signifi?
        cance. It is an earnest of the Democratic pblicy to pay its platform
        obligations.

        Which Enveloped World
        Woman suffrage was won for the
        women of all the states in the Union
        when Tennessee, the thirty-sixth state,
        ratified the Federal amendment. Ap?
        proximately 27,000,000 women will be
        entitled to vote in the Presidential
        election this fall. State suffrage al?
        ready ha^l enfranchised 17.500,000, and
        ratification adds to this number 9,500,
        000.
        Thii marks the end of the womens
        campaign for the ballot which began
        obscurely in a little meeting in Seneca
        Falls, N. Y., in 1848, swept across this
        country, and extendea the political
        freedom of women to nearly every
        other nation in the civilized world.
        Fifteen states in the United States
        already had conferred full franchise
        rights on women, and in fifteen others
        women were entitled to vote for Presi?
        dent and for certain municipal offices,
        but not for members of Congress.
        The suffrage amendment resolution
        was passed by the Congress on June 4,
        19li). Its wording was that of the orig?
        inal Susan B. Anthony amendments,
        drawn up by the pioneer suffragist soon
        after the Civil War had enfranchised
        the colored people and following the
        form of the Fifteenth Amendment. It
        reads:
        The right of citizens of the United
        States to vote shall not be denied or
        abridged by the United States or by
        any state on account of sex.
        Congress shall have power by ap?
        propriate legislation to enforce the
        provisions of this article.

        Special Sessions Called
        The fact that many state legislatures ;
        did not hold regular sessions in 1920,
        and would be required to call special
        sessions if the .suffrage amendment
        were to become effective in time f?ir
        the Presidential elections, was the last
        great obstacle the suffrage movement
        had to overcome. Even in states ?
        where the women had voted for I
        many years and where ratification was
        more or less an accepted fact the Gov?
        ernors hesitated to call special ses- !
        sions, for reasons of economy, or be?
        cause of local political issues which
        threatened to become embarrassing.

        WASHINGTON, Aug. 18. Prompt;
        promulgation of the Federal woman ?
        suffrage amendment, should the action
        of the Tennessee Legislature to-day be
        confirmed, was promised by Secretary
        Colby when word of the vote at Nash?
        ville reached the State Department. He
        was prepared, Mr. Colby said, to issue
        the necessary proclamation immediate?
        ly on receipt of official notice that
        Tennessee had ratified the amendment.
        j When the word of ratification came
        | officials of the National Womans party !
        at once sought assurances from Secre?
        tary Colby that the official action pro- j
        mulgating the amendment would not I
        be delayed. They also urged their rep?
        resentatives in Nashville to see that no
        time was lost in forwarding the official
        notice to the State Department.
        The womans party also announced
        that steps toward a national celebra-1
        tion at the cankar liad been taken. The
        date will be fixed later, and included in !
        the ceremonies will be the presentation
        to the national Capitol of marble busts
        of the rtio of suffrage pioneers Susan j
        B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton
        and Lucretia Mott -which it is hop-d i
        will be placed either in the Hall of
        Fame or the rotunda of the great !
        building. The statue of Frances Wil
        lard, presented by Illinois, is the only;
        womans figure now in the Hall of
        Fame.
        There still is suffrage work to be
        ? done, the National American Woman ;
        I Suffrage Association emphasized in a |
        I statement issued from the headquar- I
        i ters here yesterday. The association
        j takes it for granted that opposition to
        the Susan B. Anthonv amendment will i
        continue to develop and will show itself
        in court action to prevent the amend- i
        ment becoming operative.
        The association declares it is pre-j
        paring to meet any attacks which may
        be made in this direction. It expects
        the Secretary of State to proclaim the
        amendment at once as ratified, the
        statement says. This would seem to
        be automatically inevitable. Even if
        the amendment is to be the subject of
        later attack, the Secretary of States ;
        immediate task is the proclamation.1
        Without the proclamation there is no ?
        amendment to attack.
        The word male will not have to bei
        stricken from state constitutions, be?
        cause it is read out by the amendment ?
        itself, the statement asserts. The
        opinion of Charles E. Hughes is quoted
        in support, of this contention.
        Can the Presidential election be
        thrown out if women participate in it?
        the statement asks. Its answer is:
        Opponents could no more throw out
        the Presidential election or find any;
        grounds upon which to raise such a ;
        hope than they could cause the sun, to |
        stsnd still. But the suffragists, the ,
        statement says, wi??M have ground to!
        throw out an election if women were
        denied the rigrit to participate.
        Suffragists long ago ceas?jd to je
        frightened at anti-suffrage threats,
        the statement say-, none of which was
        ever quite so fatuous as this one.

        Quigley in Newark yesterday.
        Neighbors of John C. Wanner, of 1
        New York Avenue, complained that his
        pigeons were a nuisance. Wanner, who
        is a professional trainer of wild and j
        domestic animals r.nd who boasts that !
        he has disposed of many lions, bears
        and even pigs, informed the court that .
        although he had given his pigeons,
        away in accordance with a citv ordi
        nance, they persisted in flying back to
        their home roosts.
        Judge Quigley extended a weeks ;
        grace to Wanner in which to deport
        the bird3 or be fined.

        The vote by which the resolution

        Seth Walker, opponent of suffrage,
        changed his vete in order to move
        for reconsideration, so that the if?
        ricial vote stands 50 to 46.
        The Tennessee Senate ratified ?a-?;

        WASHINGTON'. Aug. ?6.The right
        of women to vote became a part of
        the Constitution of the United States
        here today when Secretary ot State.
        Colby proclaimed the Nineteenth
        Amendment a part ot the Constitution.
        The proclamation was signed early
        this morning at the home ot the Sec
        retary. It had been prepared last
        night .
        Suffrage leaders were summoned to
        the State Department as soon . tk.
        proclamation was signed and notified
        of the action. They cheered wildly
        when they were told that the amend.
        ment had been made operative. They
        naa been expecting a public ceremony
        however, and seemed to be quite dis
        appointed when they learned that
        there would be none. Theyasked
        for a repeating of the ceremony in or
        der that moving pictures could be tak. .
        en and that suffrage leaders could take
        part in the ceremony. Colby replied
        that he would consider the matter and
        reUred to his private office. The suf
        frage leaders then held a Jubilee at
        heir headquarters. Miss Alice Paul
        announced that they would not relax
        their vigilance In the least to see that
        the women of the country did not lose
        the right which they have recently
        won.
        Colby later announced that the rea
        son why there was no public cere
        mony was because he was not sure
        which group of leaders should take
        part In the ceremony. He announced
        that different groups ot women had
        argued, the question.</text>

        <text>ELECTORAL BOARDS REJECT
        FEMALE APPLICANTS
        The Elzctora! Board yesterday denied
        23 femagle applicants the right to vote
        on the grounds that such procedure is
        pot in acecordance with the Colonial Law
        or the Actof Congress of 1917 Re
        ferring to the recent statement made by
        the District Court, it said that ‘‘the
        question-‘of ‘women right to vote was not
        tne questioned at issue.”’
        This decision was arrived at by a
        joint meeting of the [own and Country
        Boards., Present were Hon. Benito
        Smith, Mr. Wilfred Moansanto, and
        Judge Thiele. Hon. D. Victor Boron and
        Mr. Emile Berne were absent.
        The Chairman, Judge Thiele, was
        requested to advise the applicants of
        the Board’s decision, individualiy today.
        The names were sent through the St,
        Thomas Teachers Association.
        Amadeo Francis, president of the
        Association said today that he did not
        know what course the organization
        would take as the matter was being
        handled through a special committee.
        An early meeting of the committee is
        planned to determine the next move.
        The following is the reply drafted by
        the Boards to the applicants: 'ln view
        of the clear statement cootained in the
        Colonial Law No. 124 of .1906. Section
        18, and act of Congress of March 3,
        1917 Section 2, which leaves nc doubt
        that women in the Virgin Islands are
        pot entitled to vote at elections for mem
        bers to the Colonial Council, and also
        considering that the said Section 18 of
        the Colonial Law and said Section 2 of
        Act of Congress, Mareh 3, 1917, have
        pever been changed by any Act of Con
        gressjor tke Colonial Council and also in
        view of the factfthat the question of
        womens right to vote was not a question
        at issue (in the receat case in the Dis
        trict Court, Peuple vs Francis) the
        Board’s members found that the ap
        plication received from women request
        inz to be accepted as voters must be
        decied."</text>

        <text>A Great National Park.
        Hon. N. P. Langford, of Slontann, the
        leader of the famous Yellowstone expedi
        tion of last year, is now in Washington,
        and, in eonneetion with Professor Hayden,
        who had charge of the government expedi
        tion of this year, is engaged in promoting
        the project of declaring all that district, in
        cluding the canon of the Yellowstone, the
        hot springs and the geysers a government
        reservation, for the purpose of holding it
        forever as a national park. Copies of the
        May and June numbers ot Scribner's Month
        ly. containing Langford's graphic story of
        "Tnc Wonders ol the Yellowstone," have
        been furnished to every member of Con
        gress. Professor Hayden lias prepared an
        article fr the February number of Scrib
        ner's. in which he confirms Langford's ac
        count. describes additional marvels discov
        d by himself, aud takes strong ground
        in favor of the park project. Such a park
        will, in time, attract to it crowds of the
        pleasure seekers and scientists of Europe
        It is not only remarkable for its scenery,
        but in a scientific point of view is said to
        be "the most marvelous region on the face
        of the earth." The illustrations, which are
        to appear in the February number of Scrib

        Written for Tire Trllntne.
        Here boglns another chnpter of our
        Story. Having crnssed the continent
        over the main line of the Northern J'n
        elllo railway and witnessed. Its Rrnmli'tir

        our HtepH tor two thousand inlloa to
        LlvliiRston and Rather up Home of the
        wonderful scenery we lost In linssin";.
        We will re-enter for that purpose the
        portal of the Yellowstone National
        Park, "Tho Wonderland of North
        America."
        When this Indian reservation was
        set aside to be forever the Brand tourist
        reHort of the people and their common
        property by the peneral Kovernnient,
        few had any Idea of the endless variety
        and stupendous grandeur of the fea
        tures embraced In tills tract of country
        Klxty-five by seventy-five miles In ex
        tent. This volcanic, region Is located
        about midway in our national domain.
        It nestles in the heart of the Kooky
        mountains covering un nrea of :i.57;i
        mpiure miles and Is encircled by ning
        liillcent snow peaks from ten to nearly
        fourteen thousand feet high. No valley
        within its limits has an elevation less
        than G.000 feet above sea level, while the
        averaK Is about H.UuO feet. This freak
        of nature is only a little spot of earth
        in the northwest coiner of Wyoming,
        coverliiff a few miles of Montana on the
        north and overlapping into Idaho and
        Montana on the west. It is one
        of thu preatPst water-sheds on the
        earth. Three of the larRest rivers in
        the United States have their source in
        Yellowstone park tho Missouri, the
        Yellowstone, the Snake. These Htrenins
        born within HlRlit of each other, lose
        themselves in three mighty rivers that
        seek old ocean thousands of miles apart
        from each other. Here, too, is the lar
        Reat body of water in North America
        lit this altitude of nearly 8,000 feet.
        Within this wonderful domain are fifty
        peysers which uro said to outclass
        MAMMOTH HOT
        nnythlnjj In the known w orld, throwing
        legulurly a column of hot water from
        thirty to two hundred and lifty feet
        in the air between intervals of from
        one minute to fourteen days, besides,
        within the boundaries of this wonder
        ous geyser land there are known to be
        una hundred geysers and 3.600 springs
        and pools, together with paint pots,
        mud springs, lukes canyons, rivers and
        small parks, ad infinitum. Here in the
        "Grund Canyon of the Yellowstone,"
        ten miles long with, an average depth
        of a quarter of a mile which 1 ac
        knowledged to be the most brilliantly
        colored landscape in existence, and
        "Mammoth Hot Springs," the only col
        ored terrace-building hot springs know n
        that liuve such beauty and magnitude;
        also cliffs of volcanic glass, mountains
        of petrefactlon, hills or brimstone, un
        surpassed waterfalls, interspersed with
        thousands of natural curiosities, sur
        rounded by perpetual snow clad peaks
        which rise Into cloudland. all of which
        fittingly characterize this as the won
        derland of America and of the world.
        ' ITS HISTORY AND DISCOVERY.
        This weird and enchanted spot Is only
        M recent .discovery. Often did the
        thought occur to us as w traversed it,
        , why was it so long undiscovered. It
        was not until 1870 that this remarkable
        locality became known, although as far
        bark as 1S06 some Inkling of what was
        to be found there was Riven bv the
        Lewis and Clark exploring expedition.
        The stories then told came largely
        from frontier guides and mountaineers
        and were disbelieved, and more than
        Ixty years elapsed before the residents
        of Montana attempted to explore it,
        althought several expeditions sent out
        by the government had crossed the con
        tinent In search of the most suitable
        route for the Pacific railway; in fact.
        the whole western domain was crossed
        and re-crossed by these exploring
        parties, and still the Yellowstone Park
        country remained undiscovered. It was
        left to John Colter (the first white ex
        plorer) to know and tell of its wonders,
        and then to General Washburn, in 1870,
        to enter the Inner wilds of this myster
        ious land, escorted by Lieutenant
        Doaae, of the United States army, and
        in 1871-72 for Professor P. T. Hayden,
        United States geologist, to make a
        thorough discovery under the sanction
        of congress and largely through his ln-

        fluence and efforts it became a national
        reservation. It peonis strange that a
        region so remarkable as this, was so
        long an unknown land to us. That,
        this is so. Is undoubtedly mvlng to the
        fact that from the east and south the
        Park Is almost impossible of approach
        on account of the character of the
        mountains. Tho region is more than
        lifty miles south of the nearest route
        traveled by explorers, besides hostile
        Indians were in this Immediate vicinity
        in very early days. Hut the question
        is aptly unsweivtl by Mr. O. 1). Wheel
        er, probably the best informed of any
        of the Northern l'ucilie olllclals, who
        says in substunce, "lod moves In a
        mysterious way, and in Ills inscrutable
        wisdom He so concealed this grand her

        until the American people were suf
        ficiently able to appreciate it. as to
        preserve it In nil tts Integrity, its nat
        ural grandeur and beauty forever. Just
        us nature made it." Since the Park
        was reserved for Its present purpose,
        congress has set aside as a "timber re
        serve" nnother tract on the south and
        east of about two thousand Bqunre
        miles, making the- entire reservation
        one-fourth larger than my native state,
        Connecticut. This ni t prevents the tim
        ber here from being cut down or want
        only burdened under severe penalties.
        SPRINGS HOTEL.
        The completion of the Northern rarlfic
        railway across the continent was an
        important event for the Park, espe
        cially so when their branch line of
        fifty-one miles brought them to Cinna
        bar at its northern boundary. Thin
        road brings the tourist from his far
        away home and sets him down amidst
        the mountains and confines of this
        wonderland. "Thus far und no far
        ther," said Mr. Wheeler to t ie, "i
        Uncle Sam's edict to railroads, and
        none may venture beyond the imagin
        ary boundary line."
        Connected with the Park are four
        Important factors, each Independent of
        the other, yet co-ordinate branches.
        These are the United States govern
        ment, the Northern Pacific railway, the
        Yellowstone Pork association, and tho
        Yellowstone National Park Transpor
        tation compuny. Like four separate,
        yet integral parts of the samo machine,
        thry work sympathetically and ,Jhar
        ninnioutdy toward tho same end. The
        avenue of annrouvh. to the Park Is one
        entirely in keeping with its character.
        Having given our readers a condensed
        outline of this mysterious land of won
        ders, we will invite them to follow us
        in our dally travels through It. We
        leave the main line of the road and
        start in to see the park at Livingston,
        for it's only through Livingston on the
        Northern Pacific road, that we can
        reach it. Livingston as described In a
        former letter, lies at the base of the
        Know and Helt ranges spurs of the
        Kocky mountains.
        Some people, like ourselves, have an
        idea, that we enter the Park on the
        same elevation above the sea, ami in
        the same manner as itv would enter
        Kaliniount Park, of Philadelphia, or
        Central Park, New York. This Is a
        mistaken idea we commence at Llv

        We do not leave our drawing-mom
        car until Ciimaliar is reached. The
        ride through this Interesting valley,
        hounded by mountains, is mi appro
        priate prelude to what follows in the
        park Itself. It Is called a park. Your
        minds shuliM be disabused of a mis
        conception. It has nothing such as an
        ordinary park would Indicate. No
        gravelled walks no velvety lawns, no
        statuary, no lower beds, etc., but all
        this extensive area Is literally crowded
        with natural curiosities of the most
        wonderful character. The hotels and
        the government roads and bridges are
        the only artificial things to be found
        here, everything else being In Its nat

        railroad passes through the first "can
        yon of the Yellowstone," which forms
        a natural entrance Into the I'pper Yel
        lowstone valley. This canyon Is about
        u mile long and Just wide enough to
        comfortably admit the read und river,
        the mountain walls rising 2,000 feet
        perpendicularly on either side. Pass
        ing through this first canyon we enter
        Paradise valley, which Is from seven
        to twelve miles wide and extends some
        thirty miles along the Yellowstone river
        which tumbles anil pounds continuous
        ly, clear as crystal and cold as Ice.
        This valley lias been settled by ranch
        men. The land Is very fertile nnd Irri
        gation has been carried on to a high
        state of perfection, making the valley
        as productive as the corn belt of Illi
        nois, The rich ranches
        yond the level upon the moraines, look
        like great Persian rugs with their har
        monious blending of colors, put this is
        not the district In which one wishes to
        specify and particularize. As the train
        moves southward, the mountain scen
        ery is ever changing and picturesque.
        The most prominent peak Is Emigrant,
        In the south end of the valley, which
        rises proudly a mile anil a quarter
        above tho valley to an elevation
        of Hi.fi29 feet. Forty miles fronr Liv
        ingston we puss through the "second
        canyon of the Yellowstone," called
        "Y'linkee Jim Canyon," named for an
        enterprising Yankee, who, prior to
        bulldliifr the railroad, built a wagon
        road through the canyon at great ex
        pense and enjoyed a lucrative business
        In collecting toll from each visitor to
        the park. Yankee Jim Is still located
        here and has many piscatorial guests
        during the tourist season, who tind the
        best of trout fishing In these swift wat-

        esque than the first, as the mountain
        walls rise higher, und Hie gorge within
        which the river Is compressed. is scarce
        ly loo feet wide. This valley Is the bed
        f an ancient lake, with glaciated boul
        ders strewn around, affording views of
        rocky i iits and spurs

        beds nearly a half mile hlh. Kxtctuling
        from the bnsq, to the summit, Is n red
        dish band of arenaceous clay about 100
        feet wide, called Cinnabar, which gave
        the name of the mountain. "The Devil's
        Slide" Is found her, formed by two walls
        of trap-rock some l.'iO feet apart, which
        precipitates 2,tHio feet down a mountain
        Hank like a toboggan slide, and Is
        strikingly realistic to the tourists. One
        says, "It demonstrates how easy His
        Satunle Majesty makes it In life for
        any one to go down hill."

        among the pleasant feutures of the

        along the Gardiner river, which has Its
        source from the snow ravines of "Klcc

        as ice; this river unites with the Yel

        nearly ii.OOO feet hus to be overcome be

        with Contain George S. Hunter as su

        cavalry. With United States soldiers
        for police, it Is the most law abiding
        section in our country today. There
        are no saloons, no gambling houses,
        thieves, highway robbers, or Indian
        massacres. No man, except he be n

        <text>SNOW IS DEEP IN YELLOWSTONE PARK AND PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT MAY HAVE TO
        USE SKIS WHEN HE GETS THERE
        In Harden Valley, Yellowstone Park.
        ROOSEVELT OA 7 SKIS.
        President May Have to Use Them
        in Yellowstone Park.
        Probably no one has ever seen a President of
        faese United States Sticking head first ma
        Vowl.ank. thrown there by a tricky pair of skis.
        Most President* have kept .way from
        banks, and the thought of mixing up with sk.s
        never entered their heads.
        The soldiers who will guide and [Presi
        de Roosevelt through Yellowstone Park when
        he reaches that interesting portion of Ins com-
        Vg Western trip may witness such a phenome
        ii o n The snow in the park is from sixteen to
        eighteen feet deep in many places, and the
        President will surely have to take to sk.s if he
        frets anywhere. He is not exactly a snowshoe
        amateur, however, and the chances are very
        uoh in favor of some one else taking the
        \ aders while the Chief Kxecutive leads the van.
        From Mammoth Hot Springs to the Golden
        Gate a distance of five miles, there is a broken
        trail and the party can ride on horseback. Be
        yond that point the park, with its white cover
        ing will seem almost as primeval as it did to
        John Colter or "Jim" Badger, the first white
        men to enter that wonderland of nature. April
        is one of the eight or nine months in which the
        park Is snowed in and the ordinary tourist
        snowed out. In May th- stage roads thaw out,
        and for three months there are visitors every
        where.
        Winter used to be the time of game harvest
        for Wyoming hunters until the government de
        cided to protect the game by keeping a com
        pany of soldiers on the reservation the year
        round. It still is the hunting season for the
        lawless "bad men" who have taken refuge in
        the Jackson's Hole Country, which is on the
        edge of the park.
        The President is going hunting for game, but
        not that ho may add to his large score of centre
        Bhots and things killed. Instead of a gun he
        will be hunting with the naturalist, John Bur
        roughs. There is no better season for seeing
        the wild game with which the park abounds.
        Larue bands of elk have been driven into the

        lower basins by the heavy snow, and it is pos
        sible that the troopers may have to feed them
        hay before the President arrives. Even the
        mountain sheep, it is said, can be approached
        within forty or fifty feet.
        Any one who knows the President must real
        ize that he will enjoy every minute of his trip
        through the. Yellowstone. In his -The Wilder
        ness Hunter" he says tli.u snowshoeing is a
        sport that must appeal to -very active sports
        man, and he ranks it with mountain climbing.
        He learned to use snowshi es in the Maine woods
        before he entered politics, and his skill with skis
        was acquired while ranching in the Had Lauds.
        Here is the story  his  rst winter hunting
        as he has written it in one of his books:
        l enjoyed the trip, for the northland woods
        are very beautiful and strange in winter, as
        indeed they are at all other times- and it was
        my first experience on snowshoes. I used the
        ordinary wcaved racquets, and as the snow,
        though very deep, was only imperfectly crusted,
        I found that for a beginner the exercise was
        laborious in the extreme, speedily discovering
        that, no matter how cold it was, while walking
        SKI RACING BEHIND HORSES.
        pleasantly invigorating, and not particularly laborious. __
        through the wilderness woods I stood in no need
        of warm clothing. But at night, especially ween
        lying out, the cold was bitter.
        "Our plan was to drive in a sleigh to some
        logging camp, where we were always received
        with hearty hospitality, and thence make hunt
        ing trips, in very light marching order, through
        the heart of the surrounding forest. The woods,
        wrapped in their heavy white mantle; were still
        and lifeless. There were a few chickadees and
        woodpeckers; now and then we saw flocks Of
        red polls, pine linnets an.l large, rosy gros
        beaks; and once or twice I came across a
        grouse or white rabbit and killed it for supper;
        but this was nearly all. Yet, though bird life
        was scarce, and though we saw but few beasts
        beyond an occasional porcupine or squirrel,
        every morning the snow was dotted with a net
        work of trails made during the hours of dark
        ness: the fine tracery of the footprints of the
        little woodmouse, the marks which showed
        the loping progress of the sable, the V and dot
        of the rabbit, the round pads of the lucivee, and
        many others. The snow reveals, as nothing else
        does, the presence in the forest of the many shy
        woodland creatures which lead their lives
        abroad only after nightfall.
        "Once we saw :i "coon out early after its win
        ter nap, ami, following, I shot it in ■ hollow
        tree. Another time we fame upon a deer, and
        the frightened beast left its "yard," a taagsl of
        beaten paths or deep furrows. The poor ani
        mal made but slow headway through the pow
        dery snow. After going thirty or forty rods it
        sank exhausted in a deep drift, and '.ay there in
        helpless panic as bjc walked .lose by. Wry
        different were the aftions of the only caribou
        we saw— a fim- beast, that had shfd its antlers.
        I merely caught ■ tilimpse of it as it leaped over
        a breastwork of down Umbers, ami we nmi
        saw it again. Alternately trotting and miking
        a succession of lung jumps, it ■peeaYlj left us
        far behind; with its great splay hoof* it could
        snowshoe better than we could. It si among
        deer the true denizen of the regions of heavy
        snowfall; far more so than the moose. Only
        under exceptional conditions of crust formalin
        is it in any danger from a man on snowshoes."
        In another chapter of "The Wilderness Hunt
        er" President Roosevelt tells how he and ether
        hunters "crust" for moose si the very Rocky
        Mountain country which he is about to visit:
        'Crusting, or following game on snowshoea,
        is, as the name implies, almost always prac
        tised after the middle of February, when the
        thaw begins and the snow crusts on tip. The
        conditions for success in era moose and
        deer are very different. A crust through which
        a moose would break at every stride may tarry
        a running deer without mishap, while th- former
        animal would trot at ease through drifts in
        which the latter would be caught as if in a
        quicksand.
        "If the snow is less deep or the
        heavy, the moose may travt-1 for s
        before it is overtaken, and this

        Moreover, it can be carried on only by those

        srowshoes are of two kinds. In the Northeast
        and in the most tangled forests of the North
        west, the woven snowshoes are used: on the

        <text>THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK IN WINTER
        An Aspect of Nature's Wonderland
        That Few Ever See
        4
        HE polar regions are hardly
        less accessible than the Yel
        lowtone National park
        the greatest playground ol
        the American people U in
        winter. This Is scarcely
        conceivable, for In summer
        40,000 visitors now find It
        one of the easiest placea to
        Teach and to travel through.
        Lieut. Frederick Schwatka made an
        attempt to explore the park in Jan
        uary nearly 25 years ago. He had re
        turned not long before from an expe
        dition in search of Sir John Frank
        lin's party that had perished in the
        arctic regions. Before that he had
        been on a 3,000-mlle sledge journey In
        the frozen north and had suffered ter
        rible hardships. On his trip into the
        Yellowstone Park Lieutenant Schwat
        ka was accompanied by a large, well
        organized party. They "traveled" on
        Norwegian jkls and Canadian web
        ' enowBhoes; but the" Snow"" as so light
        that it would not support them, and
        their toboggans were exceedingly dif
        ficult to draw. It took them three
        days to cover 20 miles. Lieutenant
        Schwatka, inured as he was to such
        hardships, fell ill and was unable to
        proceed. He and all the rest of the
        party but four of the sturdiest men
        turned back. The photographer. F.
        J. Haynes; Edward Wilson, a govern
        ment scout, and two others kept on.
        .It took them 29 days to make the cir
        cuit of the park, 200 miles. The ther
        mometer ranged between 40 and 50
        degrees below zero most of the time,
        and the adventure nearly cost them
        their lives.
        Winter Population of the Playground.
        The total winter population of the
        park is usually between four and five
        hundred people. These Include three
        troops of cavalry. The cavalry can
        use their horses only during the sum
        mer months. During the winter they
        are stabled at Fort Yellowstone. The
        stage horses are driven down to the
        lowlands, miles away, when the tour
        ist season is over, and graze In the
        sheltered valleys there until the
        nows melt
        In the great hotels that are
        thronged during the tourist season
        live only the caretakers, generally
        two in each place. a man and his
        wife. The first blizzard Isolates from
        the world outside everybody in this
        great national domain that has an
        area of 3,312 square miles. No valley
        within its limit has an elevation of
        less than 6.000 feet, while many of
        the mountain peaks within and near'
        the park rise from 10,000 to 14,000
        feet above sea level. Yellowstone lake
        IB by 20 miles in slzo, Is the largest
        body of water In America at that alti
        tude, 7,741 feet above the sea. On

        lowstone, ten miles long, has an aver
        ago depth of 1,200 feet, and is the
        most brilliantly colored landscape In
        existence. But In winter everything
        Is blanketed with Bnow eight to ten
        feet deep. All is Ice-bound except the
        more than half a hundred great gey
        sers that throw their columns of boil
        ing water hundreds of feet In the air,
        almost as little seen by humankind as'
        when they began their epoutlngs ages
        ago.
        From December to March the en

        though they were penned In by the
        polar ice. Of course the telephone
        and the telegraph bring them scraps
        of news from the outer world, but the
        only way of getting about is on
        snowshoes or skis. Even then the
        distances between the places where
        the people live are so great and the
        ways so dangerous that few venture
        forth. Only the government scouts,
        whose duty It is to look after the

        is not molested by poachers, get out
        at all. The rest of the people there
        are like the bearsthey hibernate
        until spring. An ample supply of fuel
        and provisions is laid in before the
        first snowstorms begin to sweep over
        the Continental divide, and there is
        little to do until the sun swings
        northward and the snows melt.
        Building a Hotel Amid Arctic Tem-
        r.-'i
        -r peraturj,
        Despite the arctic rigors of this re
        gion, however, 2T0 men have boen
        fighting the cold there thU winter
        completing tho fifth of the big hotels
        that are. the halting places of tour
        ists In this summer playground that
        belonxa to the iople of the United
        States. The lirst order prepared on
        the kitchen ranges of this new hos
        telry which stands on the brink of
        the great precipice down which roars
        emTlessly the mlghty cataract of the
        Yellowstone, was for nails. Nails big
        and little, brads and spikes, ten-pen
        nies and shingles, had to be heated
        on the cookstoves before the carpen
        ters could handle them. The reason
        for this baste was that the new hotel
        had to be finished In time for the
        summer season, when the park is In
        its brief period of verdant glory.
        More people will go to the Yellow
        stone National Park this year than
        ever before. In 182, when the fed
        eral government dedicated It "as a
        public park or pleasure ground for
        the benefit and enjoyment of the peo
        ple," probably not more than a thou
        sand persons a year were visiting It
        In the next twenty-three years the
        number of visitors climbed slowly to
        about 6,000 annually. In 1895, the au
        thorities began counting the persons
        who entered the park, and complete
        records have been kept ever since.
        There were 5,438 visitors in 1895.
        Ten years later the number had risen
        to 26,188. In 1904, it dropped to
        17,172. The next year it fell off near
        ly a thousand. In 1908 the total was
        18,748. Then came the most remark
        able increase in visitors that the park
        has ever known. In 1909 there were
        nearly twic as many (32,545) as the
        y'ear before This was principally
        due to the opening of a new railroad
        gateway to the park at Yellowstone,
        Mont. which made it much easier of
        access.
        A Bit of E. H. Harrlman's Wizardry.
        This came about through a visit
        that the late E. H- Harrlman made to
        the park in the summer of 1904. He
        was so Impressed by the wonders of
        the park that be immediately ordered
        the location and construction of a
        branch from the Oregon Short Line,
        a part of the Union Pacific system, to
        the western border of the park. This
        road, from Idaho Falls to Yellow
        stone, Montana, 20 miles from the
        lower 0yser basin, was finished No
        vember 12, 1907, and was opned for
        traffic the following June. It Is 107
        miles long and cost nearly $2,000,000.
        Its construction called Into play the
        greatest energy and skill In the sci
        ence of railroad building.
        Owing to the deep snows and severe
        winters work could be carried on dur
        ing only about four months of the
        ''4-. ; ;
        year, nut In that brief season, a vast
        "iny of men and machines tollou
        night and day." The giant mountain
        barriers with tl.elr dr-p valleys in be
        tween had to be conquered. That part
        of the earth whero the rails ran had
        to be remodeled so as to secure the
        safest and easiest grades. Probably
        no railway, where so many obstacles
        had to be overcome, ever was built
        in so short a time. Hut the largely In
        creased number of visitors to the
        park has proved that the new line is
        fully appreciated. Of the more than
        40,000 who entered the park last
        yeur nearly half went by this new
        western gateway that Mr. Harrlman
        created.
        The government scouts who are
        guardians of the wild creatures are
        about the only ones who ever see
        much of the winter beauties of the
        park. Those who have been there
        any length of time have learned much
        that Is new about the habits of the
        animals that abound there, although
        they are chiefly concerned In keeping
        poachers out of the park. There are
        fewer of these now than there used
        to be, because heavier penalties have
        been laid by the government on those
        who are caught.
        The few that do venture in the park
        mostly come In winter. Then there is
        less chance of being detected, but
        more risk of losing their lives In the
        cold and snow. One thing more than
        all others tempts them the buffalo.
        Unscrupulous taxidermists will pay
        the weight In silver for a buffalo head
        nowadays, for these heads are prac
        tically unattainable by legitimate
        means. The rest of the wild creatures
        that make their homes in the park are
        seldom molested.
        P.oachlng in the Deep Snow.
        It has been 17 years since one of
        these poachers after buffalo has been
        caught, but he did so much damage
        before he was arrested that it has
        taken a long time to make up for it.
        Early in March, 1894, a party was
        organized at Fort Yellowstone for
        the purpose of visiting the winter
        ranges of the game to ascertain the
        exact number of buffalo that still ex
        isted and to photograph them. The
        Oi.P 'ifttiit. UKZa; HA14'
        If .V.
        .y Kj-v
        party traveled on Norwegian snow
        shoes, with packs of sleeping bags,
        provisions and camera, direc'ly to
        Hayden valley via Norris and the
        Grand canyon. They found 81 buf
        falo in the valley, together with nu
        merous small groups of elk aggregat
        ing more than 300.
        In a secluded spot toward the end of
        the second day's march they discov
        ered the cache of a poacher. They
        were much surprised at this, as they
        had had no idea that there was any
        one in the park killing game. Ths
        cache consisted of a canvas tepee,
        sleeping bag, provisions and tobog
        gan, and they found six buffalo heads
        suspended in a tree nearby. A trace
        of fire in thei tepee led the scouts to
        believe that the poacher was not far
        away. To capture him was the next
        move. It had been snowing constant
        ly all the morning, and all the snow
        shoe tracks leading from camp were
        entirely obliterated. The scouts sep
        arated and went in different direc
        tions. When five miles from camp one of
        tbera heard a half dozen rifle shots in
        rapid succession. Hastening through
        the timber in that direction, he came
        upon an opening In the forest and saw
        the poacher. He had driven six of the
        buffalo Into the deep snow and had
        slaughtered the entire band. Ths scout
        was alone and armed only with a re
        volver. Poachers of this kind are des
        perate men. They know that the arm
        of the federal government Is long and
        Its grip sura ones it seizes them.
        Therefore tbey fight to the last No
        desperado Is more reckless of his life.
        The scout knew this, but did not hes
        itate for a moment It was still snow
        ing hard, and neither the poacher nor
        his dog noticed the scout's approach.
        The scout was within 20 feet of the
        poacher and had him covered with blB
        revolver before he told him to throw
        up his hands. A moment more, and
        w; . ' tvv ' k )
        he was disarmed. Theri he was hand
        cuffed and takeu to the guardhouse
        at Fort Yellowstone. He had killed
        about onc-elhth of all (tie buffalo In
        the park.
        Elks and Dears Very Comfortable In
        the "Big Cold."
        There are about 250 buffalo in tho
        park now. To protect them more ef
        fectually against poachers about 20U
        are kept In an liuiosure and have be
        come partly domesticated. The re

        1,000 feet in diameter, where they
        keep the Bnow trodden down. The
        bull elks patrol these "yards" at night
        so as to keep away the mountain
        lloriB and other animals that prey
        upon them.
        The elks shed their horns about the
        flrBt of March, and until they grow out
        again lead a quiet life so that their
        sprouting horns will not be Injured.
        At the time when they shed their"
        horns they are still herded together,
        and now and then a Bcout will run
        across some secluded spot in the pri
        meval wilderness where the ground is
        covered with two or three score of
        these great antlers, some of them six
        or seven feet long. They are allowed
        to remain where they are, for it is not
        permitted to take them from the park
        or even to use them for decorative
        purposes there. Hut before the end
        of the next winter they disappear. The
        field mice and other small rodents eat
        them.
        The bears that are seen around the
        hotels In the summer time, stealing
        garbage or fighting the searchlight
        when it is turned on them at night, go
        into winter quarters in November or
        December snd sleep until spring.
        There are hundreds, of them, black,
        brown and grizzly. They go into
        caves or hollow logs or under the
        roots of trees that the snow will

        in the park. Sometimes four or five
        bears will snuggle up to each other ir
        the same cave and sleep the winter
        away. It Is In winter, too, that the
        cubs are born. When the baby bear
        comes into the world he Is not much
        bigger than a rat, but be grows and
        grows In his cave, kept warm by his
        mother until spring. When he emerges
        into the light he is a full grown cub,
        quite able to take care of himself and
        fight anything of his size.
        A Paradise for Wild Things.
        Millions of trout come up into the
        smaller streams to spawn In the
        spring. Hears live mostly on berries
        and fish, when they can get them.
        Since there are no berries in the
        spring the bears break their fast on
        fish. They wade into the creeks and
        scoop them out with their paws. When
        the little bears get tired of catching
        fish In the shallow pools they go hunt
        ing for moles and work as industrious
        ly as puppy dogs digging them out of
        tho earth. Springtime, when the
        bears are lean and hungry, is their
        busiest time
        Three-fourths of the park Is a dense
        forest, a primeval wilderness. Away
        from the few hotels, the roads and
        the trails the park today is what It
        was before even a Pharaoh reigned In
        Egypt It is such a paradise for the
        wild things' that roam at will there
        that they have lees to fear, even from
        each other and from the elements,
        than anywhere else in the wilderness.
        When the fury of the winter storms
        drives the tlk, deer, mountain sheep
        and antelope Into the sheltered val
        leys and canyons they have nothing
        to be afraid of except the pelting,
        driven steel-dust of ths mountain bliz
        zards. Nature is kind even to the
        birds. On the great terraces where

        In this region, nearly 8,000 feet
        above the Bea, where tho mercury
        sinks away below zero from Hecem
        ber to March, there is far more won
        der and mystery in midwinter than
        the summer tourist ever nets a hint
        of. Civilization is miles away across j
        a wilderness of shining, snowclad
        mountains. The gale-driven snow
        dances over this waste and is piled
        into fantastic drifts. Sometimes It is
        swept with a roar through the miAin
        tain gorges faster than the swiftest
        railway train ever traveled. It covers
        to the eaves some of the big hotels.
        In summer times these places are buz

        flowers, la a mass of purest white save
        where here and there the winds have
        swept away the snow and left the bill-llant-hued
        rocks exposed. Their reds
        and yellows and purples and crtmsons
        glow the brighter in contrast with the
        surrounding whiteness. The black fo
        liage of the pines stands out sharply.
        Where the water slides over the preci
        pice and forms the Great Falls of the
        ; Yellowstone, it roars down as white as
        carded wool. Down at the bottom of
        the gorge, where the waters are swift
        and deep, they are black. There are
        ; immense Icicles 200 feet long. An ice
        i bridge a hundred feet high Is formed
        at the base of the falls.
        The great geysers play endlessly,
        each at Its appointed period, although
        no one Is there to see them. Every sev
        enty minutes Old Faithful sends lt9
        columns of water and steam 300, 500,
        sometimes 1,000 feet Into the air and

        J er times the fountain form Is a perfect

        gives off a vast cloud of drifting

        j evening, this Immutable water clock
        of the Yellowstone becomes a specter
        of ghostly white, a sight so strange

        where else where the earth Is still be- '

        To get to the new gateway to this
        wonderland by the most direct route
        the traveler branches off from the
        "'-ln Uno of the Union Pacific at Og-
        den, Utah. A night's ride In a Pull
        man lands him at Yellowstone station,
        the western entrance of tho park,
        ready for the 158 mile tour in the
        Monlda and Yellowstone stages that
        are awaiting him. The trip through
        the park may be made In five days,
        or it may be cut down to two by vis

        Many, Many Wonderful Things.
        There are many wonderful things
        on the road before one gets to the
        Yellowstone park, however. Going
        west from Ogden on the Union Pa
        cific is one of the most stupendous
        pieces of railway engineering In 'the
        world, the great Salt Lal;o cut-off that
        was constructed at a cost of $6,000.
        000 to save forty-three miles of the
        distance between Ogden and 8an
        Francisco. It crosses the Great Salt
        lake at its deepest portion and is
        102 miles long. Soms of the best
        engineers in the world pronounced
        this cut-off Impossible, but it was
        built and is one of the unique fea
        tures of American railroading.
        Another thing that attracts trav
        elers is Salt Lake City itself, which
        has been constantly in the public eye
        ever since it was a little huddle of
        wagons in the wilderness more than
        three generations ago. In many ways
        it Is one of the most remarkable
        cities in the world, and as the seat
        l of power of the religious empire of
        the Mormons It Is unique. The Taber
        nacle, with Its great organ, the big
        gest in the world, and the other nota
        ble buildings have been described
        over and over again, but no words or
        photographs can picture them ade
        quately any more than they can a
        bath in the lake Itself In water In
        which one cannot sink.
        To get to the Yellowstone National
        park or to Salt Lake City Is now one
        of the easiest things imaginable. The
        directions are simple: You go to Cg
        den by the Union Pacific, the new
        and direct route, turn to tho north
        for the park and to the south for the
        "City of the Saints."
        The "First Man on the Ground."
        It is just a hundred and four years
        since the Yellowstone territory was
        discovered. A trapper and hunter
        found it. He was one John Colter, a
        private of the famous Lewis and Clark
        ' expedition. When, in 1806, this dis-
        ' tlnguiehed band of pioneers retraced
        1 tnir K,ePs and 6taftel back to St.
        j Ixula over thf'lr route that eventually
        "v f'1"1 ......
        broke aw-ay. All by himself, he set
        out for tho headwaters of the Mis
        souri. He w-as practically forgotten
        when, four years later, he came into
        St. Louis, tattered, torn, Indian-like
        in bis ways, but bubbling over with.
        i enthusiasm.
        He had seen the most wonderful
        place in the world, ho said, where
        steam came out of the earth and
        scalding water leaped miles high,
        whero there were diabolical furnaces
        under ground. It would have been
        the "abode of the damned," he said,
        but for the fact that there was no-
        sign, for hundreds of miles, of human
        beings. Surrounded by tho curious,
        John Colter talked for days of the
        wonders he had seen. And he met
        with the fate of many; no one be
        lieved him.</text>

        is the roiiiaiiee f the life of Thomas Morati,
        A. X. A., who 011 the seventy-eighth milestone
        of his dtstingulabad career is acclaimed by the
        masters of the palette ami brush as the dean
        of Auierleaii painter. Xo other artist ran boast
        of greuter honors or the satisfaction of having
        attained such an BD Viable plaee In the world
        of art, yet this veteran delineator of nature In
        her grandest moods Is as simple as a child at
        heart.
        To the constantly narrowing circle of those
        who have long knelt at the feet of the patri
        archal American he Is affectionately known as
        Tom Moran, but to that larger number who
        alone arc familiar with the graudeur of his
        works be Is the national academician whose
        marvellous delineation of the American Rockies
        In their stupendous mlglll and glory has never
        yet been equalled.
        It Is iUlte typical of the man's character
        that while the wonder of the West should make
        Its strongest appeal upon the artist side of his
        nature the humbles) of pastoral setting should
        lie selected as his home. For it is that pictur
        esque region on the lower end of bong Island,
        In the mile village of I'.ast Hampton, amidst
        the remnants of quaint old Kngllsh houses ami
        curious old windmills that his studio home Is
        located anil where he spends elgbt or nine
        months of the year, coming In town only as
        the fancy dictates or for a brief stay in winter.
        It lies a little to one side, 011 the edge of Kast
        Hamilton's lovely environs, the pretty weath
        ered cottage when- Thomas Moran spends bis
        days with his daughter, and where come au
        nually scores of famous folk to sit at the feet
        f the veteran painter ami seek the inspiration
        that flows from his DMgVStlO iersonallty. Within
        a stone's throw of the house stands another
        shrine, which each year draws hundred of folk
        from the beaten tracks of travel to gase upon
        the hallowed spot. It Is "Home, Sweet Home,"
        the quaint shingled cottage where John Howard
        Payne, one of the nation's most hclnvisl nefs
        and writers. seiit his boyhood days. Curiously
        euniu.il the present owner of the I'ayne relic,
        0, II. Muck of Brooklyn, and Mr. Moran are
        Bloat friends as well as neighbors.
        Mr. Moran Is a familiar tic ore on the elm
        grown streets of Kast Hampton village and his
        tall, spare form and patriarchal heard seem to
        belong to the spirit of the past that broods over
        tbe place. Vet bin step Is as tlnu, Ills bauds

        as steady ami mind as alert as It has always
        been. There Is u hint of the Celt In his keen
        blue eyes and the whimsical turn of his wit, the
        Hi ft of his Irish father, ami there is the sense
        of nturdlness ami strength in his superabundant
        vitality, the heritage of his English mother.
        From the springs of such an ancestry th
        Moraus, it may he, inherited their genius, for
        as every one knows the name of Moran Is one
        to conjure hy In the art world and has been
        for half a century. From the famous quartet
        Kdwnrd, Thomas, John ami Peter have sprung
        sixteen men ami women who have In me noted
        as murine, landca, portrait ami genre paint
        ers, etchers ami magaaliie illustrators, or them
        all there were twelve who achieved such fnine
        that they (Came to he known the country uvei
        tis the Twelve Apostles, Mary Xlmnio Moran,
        wife of Thomas, was celebrated as being one of
        the best etchers In the country, an art she un
        billed from her artist husband.
        While Thomas, who mended the looms In til.'
        factory village of Lancashire, perhaps endowed
        the name most conspicuously It was to Kdwnrd,
        the oldest of fourteen children, to whom much
        credit Is due for developing the Moran talent,
        for he It was who lent the helping hand that
        startisl them 011 their art careers. It would
        sis'iu as though some conspicuous nrtlst forbear
        must have transmitted his genius to the line,
        though Edward was wont to say there wasn't
        even a sign painter In the family, albeit it is
        a well known fact that In his generation he
        himself took a hand at the trade In order to
        eke out the family Income.
        As a matter of fact the Moran ancestors
        Wert tundll 1 weavers lii and about the Eng
        lish (own where they were hum and for gen
        erations the children grew up in the factories,
        their lives woven In and out In the woof of
        their dally tasks, it might have -tin lieeu tho
        case had not an Incident occurred, as it uoine
        times does, which altered the fare of their llv -s
        ami served in time to bring the family to this
        country, where it was destined to suiue Illus
        triously. There came to tbe utile factory town an
        Itinerant artist who, probably for his bed and
        board, decorated the walls of the humble pot'
        tuges with curious animals nud weird sprawling
        vines. To the fascinations of this wonderful
        art Edward sueetiinlied ami the love of palette
        ami pigments became engrafted on his mimi us
        Interest In the weaving diminished.
        The lad Thomas was undoubtedly too young
        at that time t be materially affectod by the
        Inspiration of the travelling painter, but his
        brother began to long for a larger Held ami
        one day he left the little factory town forever
        ami set sail for America. He lauded on the
        picturesque shores of Maryland, the objective
        of many lioinesccklng foreigners In those days,
        hut the country offered little but farming, which
        to the youth In whom burned the tires of genius
        presented few attractions.
        So one Hue day, with his meagre belongings
        tie.l up In a red bandanna handkerchief, he
        walliisl to Philadelphia! where It was destined
        Ills brother Thomas and the others should fol
        low later.
        It was by no means easy sailing and he e.v-
        perlenced great difficulty in getting sufficient
        work to keep body and soul together. He vurl
        uusly tried his luck as a cabinet maker, a bronze
        worker and a house painter, but he was llnally

        IHE FAME of Yellowstone Park
        m has been so Indelibly associated
        wllh Its wonderful geysers that
        few persons know that It Is the
        only spot in tho United States where
        tho public can see in largo numbers
        tho animals of the forests and wilds In
        their natural state. In reality It Is
        tho most successful wild animal pre
        serve In the world.
        Only those who personally know
        tho West appreciate tho changes that
        havo taken place. In Its animal life In
        the past forty years. Thirty years
        ago elk and antelope existed In la'rgo
        numbers in tho Rockies from Mexico
        to Canada, but these .animals were
        killed with no thought that they might
        ultimately bo extinguished. It was
        fortunate that when tho Yollowstono
        National Park was established, In
        1S72, It occurred to somo public mind.
        2d Individuals that Its 54 by C3 square?
        miles would mako a wonderful game
        preserve. As a result there are enough
        animals now In this park, to bo of
        rreat Interest and In ycara to come It
        may form an epltomo of conditions In
        tho wilderness that once existed In
        many places In tho West.
        Thousands Or Animals
        There aro six hundred antelope, a
        thousand- or more of deer, more than
        five hundred moose, four hundred buf
        faloes, two hundred mountain sheep,
        any number of black and grizzly bears,
        and more than thirty thousand elk.
        that mako Yellowstone Park their
        homo under Government protection.
        Those animal herds uro now being
        used ns nucleus herds for other parks
        national. State and city and for
        zoological gardens, when Government
        permits. In recent years many of the
        animals particularly the elk. bears and
        bison have been quietly taken captive
        and shipped away to various parts of
        the country.
        In early days buffaloes existed in
        large numbers In tho AY est and ranged
        from the Middle West to the Rockies.
        Now the only place whero thoy arc
        found In their original habitat Is the
        Yellowstone Park. The pronged horn
        antelope apd a large variety of moose
        found near Yellowstone Lako are oth
        er Interesting park animals.
        Animals Fed In Winter
        Though most persons see the ani
        mals of the Ycll6wstone In summer
        thero arc certain enthusiastic nulmal
        lovers who go to this remarkable Park
        In winter that they may sec them as
        they como to Gardiner, the entrance
        to tho Park to get tho alfalfa hay
        which the Government harvests each
        yoar for winter food for tho Park
        animals. Though In summer all kinds
        of animals roam In the higher parts
        , of tho Park, tho winters are so scvero
        that they arc glad to como down to
        get food. So nt Gardiner, one can seo
        tho graceful deer, hundreds of striped
        antelopes, dozens of big horn sheep
        and thousands of elks who ramblo
        about, feed, and do not seem timid at
        all. Early in the morning tho big
        hay wagon starts out from Mammoth
        Hot Springs, near Fort Yellowstone,
        and carries alfalfa to Gardiner, and
        as soon as It approaches tho elk and
        antelope begin to appear. Sometimes
        they como In stately tile, with every
        appearance of a stylish dinner party,
        and at other times they mess together
        in groups of hundreds. Or thoy stand
        In line ar.d wait patiently until the
        wagon starts on its rounds of scatter
        ing feed They never puch each other,
        never quarrel, and pay no attention lo
        sightseers or photographers, though
        when thoy finish eating they stand and
        look at tho onlookers reflectively' and
        perhaps tho deer kick up their -heola
        and run In sheer playfulness. As tho
        Park lsrsurrounded.by four national
        forests the question of whether part
        of their area could bo used for graz
        ing has been discussed, but the diffi
        culty of adequate protection has been
        thq main trouble.
        Bears Arc Very Tamo
        In summer tho wild aplmals vlo In
        Interest with the geysers and most
        tourists revurn, with Interesting benr
        stories. At meal tlmo bears venturo
        near tho hotels to get the garbage and
        they aro sometimes soen in other
        places. Back In the woods, dwell Mr.
        and Mrs. Bruin, and their progeny,
        but they havo learned whero garbage
        titbits can bo found and on their dally
        excursions to get this food thoy arc
        a source of enjoyment to lookers-on.
        Seats aro oroctcd a short dlstanco
        from tho hotels at tho edgo of the
        woctl3, and here ono may sit and
        watch Bruin cat his supper. As he
        comes down from his forest home, ac
        companied by various members of his
        family, Mr, Bear, whether ho bo cln- j
        napion, black or silver tipped pays
        no attention to his audience- He is
        out for a good meal and ho gets it
        undisturbed by such harrowing prob
        lems as conservation, Hooverlzatlon
        and the like. A soldier stands guard
        for fear of somo accident for though
        It is said the henry of Yellowstone
        Park arc harmlces and a few have
        learned to cat out of some Intrepid
        persons hands, they nre" wild bears
        still. Tourists always enjoy taking
        their pictures and around Old Faith
        ful, and tho Canyon they seem quite
        domesticated. It took years for these
        bears to learn that the people In the
        Park were their friends, but they bear
        evidonco of good treatment in their
        sleek coats and fat bodies.
        Every year tho beautiful deer are
        soen along the roadways and near tho
        hotels. During tho fall, winter and
        I spring they arc a familiar fcaturo or.
        tho parade ground at Fort Yellow
        stone and they seem loss timid than
        the elk, which aro apt to seclude them
        selves In the valleys and timber. But
        a short ride from tho hotels will
        usually bring a herd in view especial
        ly in the vicinity of Shoshomc Lake
        and Haydcn Valley. By some marvel
        the animals Deem to adapt themselves
        to tho automobiles that now take the
        place of tho Park coaches. As one
        skims along In theso cars thero are
        certain retired portions of tho Pak
        where one can seo the beavers at work.
        They seem to be rapidly multiplying
        though many have been shipped to
        city parks or approved preserves. At
        Yancey's thero aro many colonics of
        these beavers Inthe brooks and they
        can be seen cutting down trees, swim
        ming, laying in their winter food and
        doing all sorts of chores as they frisk
        about their dams, .houses and slides.
        Fishing Paradise
        Of course, the fisherman gets his fill
        In this Park, whore tho waters have
        been "planted" annually over since
        1S91. It Is great fun to go fishing
        In tho lako or streams and catch the
        Loch Levin, rainbow or brook trout.
        There are few restrictions and if one JS

        I'urk, the oldest and blg
        gest of our national
        parks, the first national
        park to he established In
        the world, the largest and
        finest geyser basin on
        earth and the most famous of big
        game preserves, will probably receive
        b largo addition of territory to the
        Auth from the Sixty-sixth congress.
        A bill for this addition was Introduced
        In the lust congress, was passed by
        the house and was shelved In the sen
        Bte tn the confusion of the lust days of
        the Inst session.
        Yellowstone has n most romantic his
        tory. It was discovered In 1807 by
        lohn Colter. We bought the Louisi
        ana territory—the land between the
        Mississippi and the Rockies—of Nu
        poleon In 1802, without knowing any
        thing about this garden spot of the
        world. The Lewis and Clark expedi
        tion of 1804-8, whlèh made the round
        trip from St. Louis to the tuouth of the
        Columbia river to find out what we
        bad bought, passed within n few miles
        of the north end of the park without
        •vcn suspecting Its existence. Colter
        was one of the party and secured his
        discharge before reaching St. Louis to
        turn back and trap beaver. Colter re
        turned to St. Louis in 1810. The pub
        lic laughed nt his story and derisively
        dubbed this geyser land "Colter's
        Hell." Only one man believed him—
        his old commander, Capt. William
        Clark, who put .Ills 1807 route on the
        •fflclat mnp, of the expedition.
        In the '20s James Bridger, the fa
        mous plainsman, rediscovered "Col
        ter's Hell" and told of Its wonders.
        But Bridger was a genius in telling
        "tall yarns"—his obsidian cliff, and
        hot spring stories ure classics In the
        West to this day. "Just another of
        Jim Brldger's yarns" was the popular
        verdict. Prospectors who flocked to
        the region during various gold excite
        ments dlscnvcrjgd the Yellowstone the
        third time. But It was not until 1870
        that the country believed In "Colter's j
        Hell." Then there was popular enthu- !
        slasm and In 1872 the Yellowstone was
        aet a-dde by act of congress ns a na- !
        tlonnl park—a nubile playground for
        the people of the United Stutes for
        ever.
        Millions In Improvements.
        Paring the first 14 years of its ex
        totenee as a national park Yellowstone
        was administered by civilian superin- !
        tendent* good, bad and Indifferent, j
        Congress sometimes appropriated
        funds for the park and often did not.
        By 1880 conditions were so bad In the
        park and poachers were killing off the
        big game so fast that the management
        was turned over to the army. The |
        army record was excellent. With the
        creation of the national park service,
        two yenrs ago, exclusive control Is now
        In this new bureau of the Interior de
        partment, which Is charged with ad
        ministration of all nationnl parks.
        On the whole, congress has been fair
        ly liberal In appropriations. These to
        tal $3,980,523.84 to July 1. 1910. There
        are 278 miles of main and 25 miles of
        secondary road and nearly 400 miles
        of fairly well-marked trails. Fifteen
        ranger stations nre maintained; these
        are connected with headquarters near
        the north entrance by 270 miles of tel

        <text>YELLOWSTONE: FIRST NATIONAL PARK
        Going to "Colter's Hell" this sum-,
        nier? If so, be sure to take with
        you Uncle Sam's 1020 bulletin, just
        off the government press. It tells
        you all about "Colter's Hell"
        which is to say, the Yellowstone,
        oldest and most famous of our 19
        national parks.
        Why "Colter's Hell"? Well, It's
        an interesting story and not every
        one knows it. The story of John Colter and "Col
        ter's llell" properly begins away back In 180o,
        when Thomas Jefferson, our third president,
        bought the Louisiana territory from Napoleon
        Bonavmrte.
        The western boundary of the United States
        was then the Mississippi, as fixed by the treaty
        with Great Britain after the Involution. Jeffer
        son sent James Monroe to France to co-oirerate
        with Minister Robert It. Livingston in the pur
        chase of the Mississippi's mouth for $2,000,XH).'
        Napoleon laughed at them, lie had just made
        Spain cede him the Louisiana Territory, Intend
        ing to establish there an empire to replace that
        lost to the British In Canada. Then Napoleon saw
        be must fight the British. He could not fight and
        colonize, too. So, to spite the British, he told the
        two Americans they could have all the country
        between the Mississippi and the Itockies (Texas
        not included) for $15,(XK),000. And he made Mon
        roe and Livingston agree. Jefferson was scared
        stiff at the act of his agents. There was a nation
        wide rumpus over the purchase, but congress rati
        fied it and the people finally approved it.
        Jefferson had not the slightest idea what the
        United States had bought and in the spring of 1S04
        ho started the Lewis and Clark expedition from St.
        Louis to find out Tills famous expedition went to
        the mouth of the Columbia river and returned to
        St. Louis in lSOG, after having been given, up for
        lost. It passed a few miles to the north of the
        Yellowstone, without even suspecting its existence.
        John Colter was one of the private soldiers of
        the exiedltioii. Before it reached St. Louis he got
        his discharge and returned with two trappers to
        the headwaters of the Missouri for beaver. In the
        firing of 1S07 at the mouth of the Platte be met
        Manuel Lisa and . again turned back. Lisa built
        Fort Lisa at the confluence of tlfe Yellowstone and
        the Big Horn. Colter, going alone to summon the
        Crows lo (lie fort for trade, passed to the south of
        tlie Yellowstone tltrough Jackson's Hole to Tierre's
        Hole at the west of the Yellowstone. Returning
        thence to Fort Lisa, he passed diagonally through
        the Yellowstone, the first white man to see its won
        ders. Colter, after adventures and travels that give
        him a front rank among explorers of the west, re
        turned to St. Louis in 1S10. lie recounted his ad
        ventures and lie told of the marvels of the Yellow
        stone. St. Louis believed some of his tales of ad
        venture, but would have none of the geysers, boil
        ing springs and paint-pots of the Yellowstone.
        They derisively dubbed it "Colter's Hell," laughed
        over it for a time and then forgot it. Gen. Wil
        liam Clark, his commander, was the only one to
        believe him. On the oflicial map of the Lewis and
        Clark expedition Is a dotted line from Fort Lisa
        to the Yellowstone and return, with the legend,
        "Colter's route in 1807."
        The Yellowstone v'as discovered the second
        time about 1S27 this time by Jim Bridger, one of
        (Jen. William 11. Ashley's lieutenants In the Rocky
        Mountain Fur company. Bridger was the discov
        erer of Great Salt Lake, a map-maker without an
        equal, a mountaineer, plainsman and guide with
        no superior. But he had a hobby big yarns. It
        is he who made up those classic "whoppers" of
        the west the obsidian cliff, boiling spring, echo
        and alum creek stories. So, when he told about
        the wonders of the Yellowstone, u scoffing frontier
        said, with laughter: "Oh, just another of Jim
        Bridgor's yarns."
        Warren Angus Fenis described the Upper Gey
        ser basin of the Yellowstone in 1S-12 and was not
        believed. Prospectors in the Montana gold excite
        ment of 1802 again described the Yellowstone; they
        were set down as liars. Newspapers and maga
        zines would not publish the stories; lecturers were
        stoned. Iu 1809 the semi-official Montana Wash-burn-Langford
        expedition did succeed in getting a
        hearing. In 1870 the federal government sent an
        official exjied It ion which official ly put Mie Yellow
        stone on the map.
        Cornelius Hedges, September 18, 1S70, by a
        campflre In the Yellowstone, proposed that the
        wonderland be niado a national park a pluy-
        ground set aside for the people's use forever. The
        idea took. Congress established the Yellowstone
        National park, March 1, 1872.
        The establishment of the Yellowstone as a na
        tional park after 05 years of "discoveries" was
        the first time such a thing had been done In all
        history. It was the first national park in all the
        world. The United States set the example which
        practically all the civilized world has followed.
        Uncle Sam's 1920 Yellowstone Bulletin is a
        fascinating booklet of 103 pages of text, maps
        and illustrations. It contains everything that the
        tourist needs to know, from how to get there to 0
        time table of the geysers and from the different
        kinds of trout to the automobile regulations. The
        following items are taken from the introductory
        pages :
        The Yellowstone National park was created by
        the act of March 1, 1872. It is approximately G2
        miles long and 54 miles wide, giving an area of
        3.348 square miles, or 2,142,720 acres. It Is under
        the control and supervision of the national park
        service of the Interior department.
        The Yellowstone is probably the best known of
        our national parks. Its geysers are celebrated the
        world over because, for size, power, and variety
        of action, as well as number, the region has no
        competitor.
        The Yellowstone National park is located in
        northwestern Wyoming, encroaching slightly upon
        Montana and Idaho. It is our largest national
        park. The central portion Is essentially a broad,
        elevated, volcanic plateau, between 7,000 and 8,500
        feet above st-a level and with an average elevation
        of about 8,000 feet. Surrounding ft on the south,
        east, north, and northwest are mountain ranges
        with culminating peaks and ridges rising from
        2,000 to 4,000 feet above the general level of the
        inclosed tableland.
        The entire region is volcanic. Not only the sur
        rounding mountains but the great interior plain
        is made of material once ejected, as ash and lava,
        from depths far below the surface. Geological
        speculation points to a crater which doubtless once
        opened just west of Mount Washburn.
        There are five active geyser basins, the Norris,
        the Lower, the Upper, the Heart lake, and Sho
        shone basins, all lying In the wesMind south cen
        tral parts of the park. The geysers exhibit a large
        variety of character and action. Some, like Old
        Faithful, spout at quite regular Intervals, longer
        or shorter. Others are irregular. Some burst up
        ward with immense power. Others shoot streams
        at angles or bubble anil foam In action.
        Geysers arc. roughly speaking, water volca
        noes. They occur only at places where the Inter
        nal heat of the earth approaches close to the sur
        face. Their action, for so many years unex
        plained, and even now regarded with wonder by
        so many. Is simple. Water from the surface trick
        ling through crack In the rocks, or water from
        subterranean springs collecting in the bottom of
        the geyser's crater, down among the strata of in
        tense heat, becomes Itself Intensely heated and
        gives off steam, which expands and forces upward
        the cooler water that lies above It.
        At last the water in the bottom reaches so
        great an expansion under continued heat that the
        less: heated water above can no longer weigh It
        down, so it hursts upward with great violence,
        rising many feet in the air and continuing to play
        until practically all the water In the crater has
        been expelled.
        Nearly the entire Yellowstone region Is remark
        able for its hot water phenomena. The more
        prominent geysers are confined to three basins
        lying near each other In the middle west side of
        the park, but other hot water manifestations oc
        cur nt more widely separated points. Marvelous
        ly colored hot springs, mud volcanoes, and other
        strange phenomena are frequent. At Mammoth,
        at Norris, and at Thumb the hot water lias
        lrought to the surface quantities of white min
        eral deposits which build terraces of beautifully
        incrusted basins high up into the air, often en
        gulfing trees of considerable size. Over the edges'
        of these carved basins pours the hot water. Mi
        croscopic plants called algae grow on the edges
        and sides of these basins, painting them hues of
        red and pink and bluish gray, which glow bril
        liantly. At many other points lesser hot spring
        occur, introducing strange, almost uncanny, ele
        ments into wooded and otherwise quite normal
        landscapes.
        The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone affords
        a spectacle worthy of a national park were there
        no geysers. Standing upon Inspiration Point,
        which pushes out almost to the center of tle can
        yon, one seems to look almost vertically down
        upon the foaming Yellowstone river. To the south
        a waterfall twice the height of Niagara rustics
        seemingly out of the pine-clad hills and pours
        downward to be lost again in green. From that
        point two .or three miles to where you stand and
        beneath you widens out the most glorious kaleido.
        scope of color you will ever see in nature. The
        steep slopes, dropping on either side 1,000 feet and
        more from the pine-topped levels above, are incon
        ceivably carved and fretted by the frost and the
        erosion of the ages.
        The fossil forests of the YellowstoneNatlon.il
        park cover an extensive area in the northern por
        tion of the park, being especially abundant along
        the west side of Lamar river for about 20 miles
        above its junction with the Yellowstone. One
        traversing the valley of the Lamar river may see
        at many places numerous upright fossil trunks in
        the faces of nearly vertical walls. These trunks
        are not all at a particular level hut occur at Irreg
        ular heights; in fact a section cut down through
        these 2,000 feet of beds would disclose a succes
        sion of fossil forests. That is to say, after the
        first forest grew and was entombed, there was a
        time without volcanic outburst a period long
        enougli to permit a second forest to grow above
        the first. Tliis In turn was covered by volcanic
        material and preserved, to.be followed again by a
        period of quiet, and these more or less regular al
        ternations of volcanlsm and forest growth contin
        ued throughout the time the beds were iu process
        of formation.
        The Yellowstone National park Is . the largest
        and most succesNful wild animal refuge In the
        world. It Is also, for this reason, the best and
        most accessible field for nature study. Its. 3.300
        square miles of mountains and valleys remain
        nearly as nature made them, for the 2HJ miles of
        roads and the four hotels and many camps are as
        nothing in this immense wilderness. No tree has
        been cut except when absolutely necessary for
        road or trail or camp. No herds Invade Its val
        leys. Visitors for the most part keep to the beat
        en road, and the wild animals have learned in the
        years that they mean them no barm. To be sure
        they are not always seen by the ioople In the
        automobile stages which whirl from point to point
        dally during the season; but the quiet watcher on
        the trails may see deer and bear and elk and an
        telope to his heart's content, and he may even see
        mountain sheep, moose, and bison by journeying
        on foot or by horseback into their distant retreats.
        It is an excellent bird preserve also; 20U spe
        cies live natural, undisturbed lives. Eagles aro
        found among the crags.
        Trout fishing in Yellowstone waters Is unex
        celled. All three of the great watersheds abound
        in trout, which often attain large size. Yellow
        stone lake is. t lie home of large trout, which are
        taken freely from boats, and the Yellowstone riv
        er and Its tributaries yield excellent catches to the
        skillful angler.
        The criticism often made by persons who have
        visited granite countries that the Yellowstone re
        gion lacks the supreme grandeur of some others
        of our national parks will cease to have weight
        when the magnificent Teton mountains just south
        of the soiflhern boundary are added to the park.
        These mountains begin at the foot of the Pitch
        stone plateau a mile or two below the southern
        gateway and extend south and west. They bor
        der Jackson lake on its west side, rising rapidly
        in a series of remarkably toothed and Jagged peaks
        until they reach a sublime climax, 30 miles south
        of the park, in the Grand Teton, which rises cathedral-like
        to nn altitude of 13,747 feet. ,
        These amazing mountains are, from their na
        ture, a component part of the Yellowstone Na
        tional park, whose gamut of majestic scenery they
        complete, and no doubt would have been Included
        within its original boundaries had their supremo
        magnificence been then appreciated. Already Yel
        lowstone visitors have claimed It, and nutomohllo

        <text>Jim Bridger, discoverer of Yellowstone Park, whose stories no one
        would believe when he first reported his miraculous "find" is shown in the
        upper right. Jim died years ago, but the bear here shown lives on, and
        will help golden anniversary year tourists in their vindication of the old
        trapper's wondrous yarns at the gala fiftieth year. Below is one of the
        big park busses, being loaded at Old Faithful camp.
        GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY OF YELLOWSTONE PARK
        Jim Bridger's Biggest
        Lie Was the
        Truth
        Tears ago old. Jim Bridger was
        one of the earliest travelers of the
        Yellowstone.
        But when he tried to tell of the
        gigantic geysers, rivers that ran
        cold on top and hot on the bottom
        and
        country laughed at him, and he be
        came known as the grtatest liar of
        his time.
        waterfalls, the
        monstrous
        A rough deal,, indeed.
        But 1922 marks the golden anni
        versary of the Yellowstone National
        Park. And this year every traveler
        who goes to the wonderland to help
        ceelbrate the gala year, every deluxe
        train that runs from Salt Lakt City
        to the park entrance at West Yel
        lowstone, will be a vindication for
        poor old Bridger.
        His biggest "lie" was the truth.
        • There have been many changes to
        the Yellowstone since Bridger's day
        as travelers who come this year will
        find. Where he went in overland
        with pack horses, they roll in over
        a steel highway in de luxe trains,
        whose service this year will be
        doubled. In addition to the famous
        "Yellowstone Special" which nightly
        flashes over the rails from Salt Lake
        to the park entrance, there will be
        a daylight train, which will enable
        the visitor to see the scenic moun
        tain wonders of the Targhee forest,
        en route to the park itself.
        Arriving at West Yellowstone,
        more changes are evident. Where
        Bridger went thru the brush, and
        used river beds as trails, this sum
        mer's traveler will find a matchless
        system of highways, with automo
        bile transportation awaiting him.
        He can select any one of half a
        dozen trips thru the wonderland.
        Instead of mountain trails there is a
        system of matchless highways.
        Hotels with every modern comfort
        and convenience await him in the
        heart of the wilderness. Permanent
        camps offer equal comfort and at
        traction. But both hotels and
        camps have been so skillfully con
        structed that their rustic log archi
        tecture adds to the natural wild
        beauty of the whole.
        Thru all this is a wonderful sys
        tem of co-operation between gov
        ernment, railroads, hotels, camps,
        and transportatoin that enables
        100,000 people to se the whole park
        annually. And yet with all these
        changes, so have they been kept to
        the spirit of the place, the park is
        the same old Yellowstone.
        Only one change is the reverse of
        what it seems it should be. The
        animals, wild in Bridger's day, are
        tame now.
        hand.
        lordly heads to watch the bus cara
        vans roll by. Deer pause by the
        roadside and eye them speculatively.
        Mighty rainbow trout leap from the
        river to tempt the anglers.
        Clear and deep, the Yellowstone
        river flows on, unchanged. The
        voice of the falls booms forth in the
        key it used when the moon was
        young, the geysers spout at the
        regular intervals as they did before
        Columbus made his historic first im
        migration to American shores. Deep
        carpets of pine needles, the accumu
        lation of centuries invite rest in the
        shadows of pines that started grow
        ing when the ground first grew cool.
        Unusual activity is promised for
        the geysers this year. The snow
        fall was adbnormally heavy last
        winter, and the moisture which will
        make the falls and cascades of un
        usual beauty will add to the sensa
        tional performances of boiling
        springs, geysers and mud pots.
        Even nature has assisted, this
        year, in the vindication of Jim
        Bridger's suspected tongue, and the
        stage is set for a wonderful opening
        of the park's fiftieth anniversary.

        <text>YELLOWSTONE PARK
        PREPARING TO CLOSE
        SUCCESSFUL SEASON
        Yellowstone Park, region of won
        ders and the country’s largest game
        sanctuary, has begun preparations
        for winter at the close of its most
        successful season.
        Fifteen thousand private cars
        have been registered in Yellowstone
        so far this season, and it is ex
        pected that the total number of
        registrations will exceed 15,500.
        The animals are drifting down
        from the high ridges to the sun
        warmed and grass filled valleys
        while the rangers ration the out
        lying snowshoe cabins and cut the
        winters wood. Meanwhile vacation
        ists continue to travel through the
        Park in numbers far greater than
        ever before.
        Rail travel to Yellowstone ceases
        September 20, and on that date
        the hotels, permanent camps and
        transportation company likewise
        cease operation for the season. Per
        sons in private automobiles will be
        permitted in the Park as long as
        the weather permits, which should
        be until about the middle of Oct
        ober.
        The motorist who comes to Yel
        lowstone after the close of the reg
        ular season will find stores open
        at the main points of the Park.
        The Hamilton stores at Old Faith
        ful and Lake will also be ready
        to accomodate a limited number
        who desire board and lodging. At 1
        Mammoth hot Springs and Yellow- j
        stone Canyon, the Whittaker stores
        will be open for trade.
        Old-timers predict a heavy winter
        and Yellowstone seems to deserve
        it, after the big summer it exper
        , ienced. Fully 30,000 more people
        will have visited the Park when the
        gates are closed in 1926, than in i
        1925. And 1925 was a record year.
        The total season travel figures will
        approximate 185,000.
        Many things were accomplished 1
        during the summer —new roads I
        t °re built, increased accommoda- :
        tions for tourists afforded, and many!
        distinguished visitors entertained.,
        Royalty, the govenors of nearly half
        of the United States and prominent
        people form all over the world came
        to Yellowstone.
        On August 1, the Chicago, Milwau
        kee and St. Paul railroad opened a
        new entrance to Yellowstone thru
        the Gallatan valley and canyon with
        auspicious exercises. Park busses
        bring passengers along this route
        to West Yellowstone and Old Faith
        ful.
        The new highways opened within
        the park consist of a twelve-mile
        stretch along the shores of Lake
        Yellowstone which replaces a por
        tion of the road from West Thumb
        to Lake hotel and a three-mile
        drive along the west rim of the
        Grand canyon to Inspiration point.
        Construction work has now pro
        gressed rapidly on the new Fire
        hole canyon road, three miles long
        and of great scenic value. The
        Cody road in the park east of Sul
        van pass will be closed on October
        first to undergo complete recon
        struction. It will be open for trav
        el as usual in 1927.
        New wooden cabins were added
        to all of the permanent camps and j
        at Lake Yellowstone the camp
        lobby was enlarged through the
        addition of a dining room and re
        creation hall wing. More house
        keeping cabins were provided this
        year in the auto camps, and an
        entirely new camp is under con
        struction at West Thumb of Yel
        lowstone lake. The Union Pacific
        railroad opened a charming and
        thoroughly complete rustic dining
        room at West Yellowstone station
        for the 1926 season.
        Yellowstone was happily untouch
        ed by the great forest fires that
        swept so many acres in the north
        west during the summer. An hon
        orary ranger force was created and
        the Crown Prince and Princess of
        Sweden chosen the intital members
        because of their interest in the
        park, displayed during a five-day
        visit.
        Members of the Sierra Club of
        California spent three weeks hiking
        along the Yellowstone trails, and
        conventions were held in the park
        by the Izaak Walton League of
        Wyoming and by several trade as
        sociations and insurance companies.</text>

        gee-o whi-iz, but that was
        a bump!"
        It was our filcrnl from
        tlu sand dunes of Indiana,
        Michigan, Illinois, Ohio,
        Minnesota, Wisconsin, or
        any other state with plen
        ty of faiming districts,
        trying out a thriller at
        Coney Island, Atlantic
        Cilty, one of Chicago's big
        four amusement parks or
        for that matter at any city or town
        which supports these summer devices
        for extracting coin of the realm from
        thme plebeians.
        No matter how stolid he may be In
        life's ordinary pursuits or how emo
        tionless in an lnterurban wreck, his
        spine- curls, his sjmpathetic nerve
        system tickles and ho Is compelled
        to give himself up to thrills. You can
        find him in every resort whore there
        are scenic railways, roller-coasters,
        velvet-coasters, figure-eights., shoot-the-chutes,
        dip the-dips, leap-the gaps,
        ticklers and scores of other modes for
        shooting the electric currents up and
        down the spinal cord of the laughing,
        howling public.
        He is a source of amusement for his
        tutored city brother who tickles the
        day ledger with a pen during daylight
        and cavorts about on amusement de
        vices throughout the summer evenings.
        The city pleasure-seeker has much of
        this sport and the thrills fail to rise
        up in his anatomy the way they do in
        that of tho man, woman and child who
        are taking their first tutu at the
        game.
        Statisticians claim that there are so
        many actual thrillers of different cali
        ber and variety at woik daily in tho
        United States that If one should travel
        on overy ono of them, just once, the
        trip would take all summer. There
        were more this year than ever before.
        If all of the tides were strung out
        they would reach clear across the con
        tinent, high browed scientists claim.
        But that only goes to show that
        America is amusement-crazy. Tho
        populace and the elite, too, can't get
        enouph thrill. Not long ago, an Illi
        nois man with an idea pioposed to in
        stall an automobile in the parks of tho
        country and this device was scheduled
        to run down an Incline, turn n double
        somersault and alight upon its wheels
        again. America's thiillers are terrific
        and getting more so each year, but
        the man from tho middle west was
        perhaps a bit piemntuio with his
        death-defying machine. Sometimes it
        didn't alight as per progiam.
        Tho process of starting a thrill
        through tho pleasuie-seokers frame
        consists of lajlng out a device which
        combines both speed and tho unexpect
        ed. This subject has been studied
        by overy amusement manager In tho
        "United States and they can't get tho
        jumps, diop3 and bumps lowr enough
        or fast onoush to attract your shokols
        from your bank account to their coffcis
        wlthtiio deshed rapidity,
        "Say, by heck, I'm afeared to ride
        on thet shobang. It don't hev a safe
        look, to mo."
        Well, huitllng tluough tho air fastor
        than an aeroplane in working order
        cettalnly doesn't look safe, but at the
        came time tho visitor to the city who
        made that romark did not know whore
        of ho spoko. Every single dovico, no
        matter how small, how liigo or how'
        "safe-looking," is requited to undergo
        a rigid test by the building commis
        sioners, before being allowed to accept
        thn public's dimes. Thoto must b? a
        block system of lights, much tho saniH
        as that used by railway systems, also
        Btoppago devices on every Incline to
        prevent cars, chalra or other seating
        -vehicles riom sliding backwaids down
        an Incline.
        Tho framework of tho device Is test
        ed for Its strength and mado to sup
        port far Heavier wights Uiod nro evor
        after made Its burden. On tho curves
        of riding thrillers there Is the usual
        horizontal track above the wheels of
        tho vehicle to prevent It from leaving
        tho scheduled pathway. Persons pos
        sessing weak hearts are forbidden the
        thrills and few accept the chance to
        test that organ when In bad condition.
        There are also straps, chains, guards,
        etc., to hold tho patron In the car and
        If he or she falls out It Is little short
        of a miracle and only once or twice
        a season are accidents reported, so
        carefully do tho amusement managers
        guard the lives of those who provide a
        method of bread-winning.
        Perhaps tho scenic railway is known
        more generally to those who would
        lino their Interiors with momentary
        thrills. This rido consists of a series
        of cars strung together. There are
        brakes between each car and tho
        levers are manned by strong-armed
        boys from the railway yards. To them
        there aro no thrills. It's monotonous
        ns driving the cows home from pasture
        for them. Even catching a pair spoon
        ing while the train is running through
        the blackness of a mimic Canadian
        forest, can't mako them feel weary. It
        happens on every trip.
        Tho average scenic railway runs up
        a 45-degreo incline or rather Is hauled
        up by a chain and you are ready for
        tho first dip. The brakemen release
        their lovers and down tho cars go
        faster than tho New York-Chicago 1S
        hour limited. If the uninitiated puts
        his head between his knees ho Is apt
        to kick himself in tho face on the
        journey up tho hill which follows
        every dip. Thereforo If you haven't
        yet boon bounced around in this man
        ner, hang to tho Iron guard, stick your
        hat under your arm, grit your teeth
        and make up your mind not to care If
        your hair does get mussed.
        After tho train has completed tho
        first series of dips there is usually a
        journey tluough a dark recess, tragi
        cally known as tho "cavern," this
        being installed to give the spooncrs a
        chance to gloat over their nerve. Tho
        rest in a repetition, generally.
        Next in line as a death defying con
        ttlvanco Is the coaster. Thoro are
        fewer cars and not so many seats In
        each vehicle. Then, too, the coaster
        needs no hauling up a second Incline,
        for thoro Is only one, tho difference be
        ing noticeable in tho length of tho de
        scents. In somo patks in both east
        and west there has been a tendency of
        late to turn the coaster into a soml-loop-tho-loop,
        that Is to say, tho cars
        dtop off Iho top of tho' runway onto a de
        scent at an nnglo of about TO degrees,
        dtopplng about 80 feot, and then qtart
        up tho ascent at an angle which Is not
        quite so abrupt. Somo coasters havo
        only ono of theso terrifying dips, while
        others havo about 20 It seoms to tho
        first-nighter. Well, ono Isn't so bad,
        but about tho third jump you begin to
        calculato that tho seat must have
        slipped out tho bottom of the cat
        you're so high In the air most of tho
        tlmo.
        Passing on to another part of tho
        resort you strlko tho flguro-elght.
        Every hamlot has Its figure-eights
        theso days. That conttlvanco is fash
        ioned llko an "8" and much resembles
        tho coaster, except that the cars follow
        tho lines of tho figure, tho dips aro
        smaller and you naturally don't got
        so fussod up. It's tamer in fact, and
        for that reason graduation from tho
        figure-eight entitles you to piostlgo,
        which should carry you fearlessly over
        tho jumps which tho coaster takes and
        allow you to blandly hand tho "second-
        TBg JCgmC
        ride-lady" 20 cents for another trip for
        yourself and friend.
        Then there's the tickler. That's a
        new rido just put on In the west this
        season. You get into a round car and
        the device Is dragged up an incline for
        tho downward thrill. Starting down It
        enters a labyrinth of rails, the car re
        volving in ono direction and the de
        scent carrying it In another. This
        gives a remarkable opportunity to
        learn how it feels to bo jerked in two
        directions at tho same time.
        Tho Potsdam railway is a practical
        device, "made in Germany," which
        runs on an overhanging rail and which
        magnates among the Teutons threaten
        to mako a conventional mode of travel
        there within, a few years. The thrill In
        this consists of hoping It won't fall
        off this trip.
        Amusement-loving Americans also
        havo tho aerostat. Cars aro suspended
        at tho ends of long cables, you are
        locked in and tho device is started. It
        is like a Maypole, except that the
        cables don't become interwined around
        tho polo. As the speed Increases the
        cars rise higher at the ends of the
        cables and, inclined, speed through
        ether far out over tho heads of the
        multitude. Anyone who is susceptible
        to sea-sickness might possibly become
        immune by this treatment for 'the
        blues of everyday life. The giant
        swing, while it is not much like the
        aerostat, gives the same feeling to
        some.
        Then there Is the airship, which ma
        jestically winds about the outside of a
        tall tower and then winds down again.
        Merry-go-rounds aro numerous and
        despite the fact that this is tho father
        of all thrills, It still has its patrons
        among tho children.
        Among tho time-honored creations is
        tho shoot-the chutes, which consists of
        a slldo down a toboggan and a few
        bounces after tho boat strikes the
        wator of tho lako at tho bottom of the
        chute. If you're- wise you'll not sit
        In the front seat. Thete's where tho
        big bump comes and tho occupants of
        tho bow of the boat feel the leaps over
        tho water most.

        <text>CELLAR DOOR APOTHEOSIS
        Gigantic Industry That lias Been
        Built on the Craving to Slide.
        The male American, from the time when his
        first trousers make him feel proud, has just one
        passion that is stronger than his love for at
        tending; fires. It is his desire to slide down hill.
        If during those early years he finds a cellar door,
        banister, haymow or hillside of snow or slippery
        i grass and does not try it? friction on hi 3
        trousers, then there is a good and painful rea
        son for his temperance ten rimes out of every
        ten. The female American, who at a tender
        ape makes herself as much like the male as she
        can. follows his example in this matter and
        slides whenever she dares to. minding her
        mamma only when she is afraid.
        And even in grown-up days, when you see a
        particularly fine mahogany stair rail sweeping
        down from top to bottom of a house, with a
        graceful, rounded on* spiral at the end and not
        a post or an obstruction anywhere — you kno^r
        what is the first thing you think of. And if you
        were quite sure that nobody could possibly see
        you, and that you wouldn't fall off. and that
        ! you could catch yourself at the end. and that
        I your stomach wouldn't get in the way and youß
        glasses would stay on — well, of course you can't
        be sure of any of these things. Only if you
        could, who knows what might happen?
        That longing to "let her rip," to surrender
        yourself unresistingly to the force of gravity,
        goes very deep into your being. It is civilized
        ' human nature crying out for contact with an
        essential force, crying to be set free, if only for
        an instant, from the paths of every day. hum
        drum existence. The longing is none the less
        deep because it seems ridiculous. It is a real,
        strong, primeval instinct. Now, in any strong
        human desire there is a great deal of money for
        the man who knows how to satisfy it and i 3
        willing to sell satisfaction at reasonable rates.
        Hence the roller coaster. It stands in Scot
        land, in Coney Island, in Brazil, in Yucatan.
        It is numbered in tens of thousands, and mill
        ions ride In it every year. It has made its in
        ventors millionaires. Yet they took only tha
        essence, the spiritual part, of the cellar door,
        freed it from its homely surroundings, exalted
        it. elaborated it, capitalized it and made it a.
        mint to coin the cellar door impulse into good
        currency. The mint works on a grand scale.
        The first roller coaster was 4.» feet Ion:;, an{
        the highest drop on the line was one of ten feet.
        The thrill was somewhat more intense than that
        to be gained from a parlor rocking chair; it was
        rather more like the sensation of working 4
        wooden lawn swing. To-day there is a rolle?
        coaster at Brighton Beach where the track is
        11G feet high at one point, and there is a drop
        of eighty-five feet. "When the car plunges down
        that descent the passenger literally leaves his
        scat for an instant, and a3 he sees Coney Is!a:r4
        leaping up to meet him he knows how a base*
        ball feels when a .400 batsman swings on if t
        with the bases full.
        That first roller coaster cost $1,500. The bisj
        3cenic railways at Toney Island to-day coa|
        about $00,000 each. The smaller ones, such a3
        are shipped cut to Rio de Janeiro or Yokohama,
        represent an Investment of S-K>,<">oo each before
        they have carried a passenger. It is estimated
        that 550,090,000 is invested in sliding- amuse
        ments of one sort or another in the United
        States alone. More than half the population o?
        the country lives within an hour's ride of ons
        or ancther of them, for they are in a thcusan 1
        of our clues. If the cellar door impulse is not
        turned into hard dollars it is certainly not for
        lack of the machinery to do it or of willingness
        to furnish the machinery. A single firm, tha
        same which operated the first switchback' in
        1884, now has $8,000,000 Invested in the busi
        ness. Its profits are enormous.
        In one season a roller coaster frequently pays
        for itself. Earnings of loss than CO per cent for
        a season are rare. Two thousand dollars is a
        good figure for a Sunday's receipts. The- fare 13
        10 cents a ride. That means that twenty thou
        sand thrills of cellar door satisfaction have be< a
        mint, d into hard cash.
        Go to Coney Island and sec how natural the
        process is. When you have felt the cushion* d
        seat plunge down from under you and have
        caught your breath to tide yourself over the bis
        drop that is coming; and have felt tho car
        charge up the next steep slope with a rear :.r.l
        1 !-:. that is good to hear, and when you have
        giuwu supercilious at the easy motion with
        whi h it takes the later undulations, and then
        have had the whole ride all over again, you '.vill
        come out at the c nd and be quite ready to own.
        that it is well worth 10 cents and that you will
        ride again, to-day or next week, as circum
        stances may fall out. You have it firmly ;L:c:i
        in your mind that it is worth 10 cents.</text>

        <text>HONESDALE GIRL KILLED AT CONEY
        Riding in "Roller Coaster"
        Which Jumps the
        Track
        MISS KALLIGHAN WAS BORN IN
        HONESDALE AND LIVED ON
        ERIE STREET.
        Two women, Mrs. Alice Prevost, of
        Jersey City, and Mary A. Kallighan,
        formerly of Erie street, Honesdale,
        were killed Sunday evening when the
        last car of a three-car train on tho
        " Giant Racer," a high roller coaster
        at Coney Island, left the rails. Their
        bodies were Wedged between the side
        of the overturned car and tho guard
        rail and badly crushed. Two women.
        and a boy, the other occupants of the
        car, were painfully but not seriously
        injured.
        The coaster where the accident
        happened is about eighty feet above
        the street and firemen had to use
        scaling ladders to reach the spot and
        extricate the bodies of the victims.
        Miss Kallighan was born in Hones
        dale 41 years ago, where she resided
        with her mother until about eight
        years ago, the family having since
        lived In Scranton. The deceased was
        a lovable young woman and com
        manded the respect of many Hones
        dale friends, who are grieved to learn
        of her accidental death. .
        Besides her widowed mother, Mrs.
        Kathryn Kallighan, the deceased Is
        survived by five brothers and one
        sister, namely: Thomas, John and
        William, all of Scranton; Michael, of
        Batavia, N. Y. ; James, of High Lake,
        Wayne county, and "Mrs. Margaret
        Smith, Jersey City'.
        The remains of Miss Kallighan
        will arrive in Honesdale Wednesday
        morning and the funeral will be held
        from St. John's Roman Catholic
        church Wednesday morning at j.
        o'clock. Interment will be made in
        Honesdale.</text>

        ROLLER-COASTER KING. Straightaway plunges weren’t enough for Joe McKee — he had to throw in the "airplane dip"
        ALLAN GOULD
        HY I'KSKIN
        “THE ROCKET’ also promotes romance
        By his own admission Roller-Coaster Joe
        McKee, an apple-cheeked, gray-haired
        little man of 62, is Cupid's most active assis
        tant in the promotion of rapid-fire romance.
        He figures he must have thrown at least a
        million couples into each other’s arms
        throughout the civilized world in the last 39
        years.
        He’s accomplished it all with the “airplane
        dips” which he builds into his roller coasters.
        He also designs and constructs about every
        other kind of ride that can plunge, whirl, jolt
        or otherwise reduce a person to near hysteria
        or happy nausea.
        As sensitive to comment as a playwright on
        opening night, he likes to stand near the exit
        gate. If he hears a patron gasp: “Oh brother,
        where's my stomach!" he knows the ride
        measured up to expectations.
        He has received many glowing testimonials
        from abroad. A Havana police chief compli
        mented him on causing a near riot. A visiting
        Italian delegation, after a demonstration ride,
        asked him to make a coaster in Milan. A
        French dental society reported that business
        in false-teeth replacements boomed when he
        constructed a roller coaster in Paris.
        Tributes such as these McKee takes in his
        stride. Maintenance men are always finding
        false teeth, toupees, hats and women’s shoes
        in and around his roller coasters. The shoes
        He’s the man who put the thrills and
        chills into roller coasters, but his
        biggest pride is that he’s thrown a
        million couples into each other’s arms
        puzzle him. He has yet to discover how their
        owners leave an amusement park without
        them.
        Dean of roller-coaster designers and one of
        a handful of men in the profession. McKee
        studied the*art under the late John A. Miller,
        of Chicago. Miller was the originator of many
        amusement-park thrill rides and held virtu
        ally all patents connected with early-day
        roller coaster#.
        They Had a Future
        They were relatively tame contraptions
        back in 1905 when McKee, then 18, began
        his apprenticeship on amusement rides. His
        father, a Pittsburgh contractor, was con
        structing Luna Park in that city. Young
        McKee got a job as a carpenter.
        When the job was finished. McKee went to
        Mexico City where another Luna Park was to
        be built. His father wanted him to remain in
        Pittsburgh and go into the contracting busi
        ness, but Joe had become fascinated by roller
        coasters. Like horseless carriages, he told his
        father, they had a future.
        In 1907, after spending 18 months in
        Mexico City, McKee went to work on an
        other amusement-park project. Electric Park,
        in Kansas City, Mo. There he met Joe Miller,
        who was constructing the roller coaster.
        McKee became his assistant, soon developed
        ideas of his own.
        “All the dips in roller coasters up to that
        time were vertical on a straightaway,” McKee
        explains. “They provided thrills without
        romance. Girls were more modest in those
        days and they’d have to be awfully scared to
        grab the feller they were riding with when a
        car hit a dip.
        “A roller coaster is a gravity ride. I got to
        thinking about how gravity, like nature,
        should be allowed to take its course. I figured</text>

        <text>ACTRESS DIANA DORS (second from left) and companions are plastered against the wall as the floor falls away. Centrifugal force holds riders in place
        KIDS are crazy about it, “ride” better than adults
        It’s the British answer to the American roller
        coaster. Look what happens on the Ridawall
        Photographs by George Konig
        One of the top attractions for visitors at the London Circus this year is a
        complicated thriller known as the Ridawall. Britons feel this human
        whirlpool provides an answer to the U.S. roller coaster.
        A circular wall. 10 feet high, revolves at high speed. All you do is stand
        against it and centrifugal force holds you there. Then somebody drops the
        floor out from under you and there you are — stuck to the wall. After a while
        they bring the floor back and you totter away, slightly dizzy.
        The ride is a big favorite with kids, who spend all their money on it and
        then hang around hoping for one on the house. They're apparently much
        more skillful than adults in assuming weird positions while plastered against
        the wall.

        be taken off the rails. If you keep
        your seat on a roller coaster it
        will bring you home.”
        This does not always happen.
        As an authority on thrill rides,
        McKee is also investigator of
        accidents for Lloyds of London
        in amusement parks throughout
        the country. The chief causes of
        such accidents, he says, are
        reckless people and show-offs.
        They are also hardest to spot.
        Yon Can't Fool
        Last year one of two sailors
        riding in the seat of a roller
        coaster suddenly decided to talk
        to two girl passengers in the car
        behind. He got up and started
        backjust as thecars went into
        a dip. He was thrown out and
        killed.
        “Things like that,” says
        McKee, “are comparatively rare.
        But they’re almost impossible to
        prevent. You just can’t start
        fooling around on a roller
        coaster.”
        Drunks cause little trouble on
        the roller coaster itself. They
        sometimes create brief disturb
        ances at the entrance, but they
        are shooed firmly away by
        vigilant attendants.
        “You can usually spot a drunk
        quickly enough by the way he
        hesitates about getting into one
        of the cars,” McKee explains.
        "He seems to debate with him
        self as to whether the ride will
        sober him up or make him sick.”
        For Relaxation
        McKee believes that the most
        consistent patrons of a roller
        coaster are deaf and dumb
        people. Sometimes they will take
        as many as a half-dozen rides in
        the hope of improving their
        voices or hearing.
        “We get a great many people
        with psychological problems,
        too,” he says. “Some come for
        relaxation; some for excitement.
        Psychologists send a lot of them
        to unload their emotional ten
        sions. You find all sorts of people
        around a roller coaster. I even
        met my own wife there.”
        This happened back in 1912
        when McKee had completed a
        roller coaster at Chester Park in
        Cincinnati. He found that he
        had to skimp on the width of a
        ticket booth.
        “I told the operator that I had
        to make the booth only thirty
        inches wide and he’d have to
        hire a cashier with a narrow
        fanny,” says McKee. “He told
        me not to worry, He’d hire
        Margaret Drew, a young lady
        who was slight enough to fit.
        "I decided that since I was
        responsible I’d stay over a day
        or two to see if she did. Then
        when I met her, I took her for a
        ride on my roller coaster and
        through the Tunnel of Love.
        The combination certainly
        worked in our case.”
        Cheap Collisions
        Together with more speed and
        thrills, amusement-park patrons
        these days demand what McKee
        calls an “active participation
        gimmick.” Example: a field of
        miniature motor cars where
        the traffic-harassed motorist
        may wham his little vehicle
        into others.
        Another, the circle swing, first
        of all airplane-type rides, is now
        being built with a control stick
        so that riders can partially guide
        the motion of their “plane.” One
        of the latest of such devices
        is the “Looper,” a circular ride
        in which passengers may con
        trive to roll themselves into an
        upside-down position.
        And of course there’s always
        the caterpillar. McKee once built
        one of these for England, and got
        a complaint about the skirt
        blowers. The staid English want
        ed three of these devices instead
        of the usual two.
        How To Be a Hero
        McKee regards these and simi
        lar innovations with benign tol
        erance. None, he believes, will
        ever replace the basic appeal of
        the roller coaster.
        “John Miller’s early roller
        coaster made it possible for a
        man to be a hero in his girl’s
        eyes for two bits,” he points out.
        “With the airplane dip I added
        fast romance.”
        No amusement-park patron
        could ask for more. The End</text>
